# Project Lessons Log

This file aggregates critical lessons, anti-patterns, and newly established operational rules obtained through project development.
Based on the "Continuous Improvement — Auto-Crystallization Protocol" in `AGENTS.md`, the AI autonomously manages this file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Auto-Crystallization Protocol**
>
> This file functions as a **lesson index and temporary accumulation point**.
> When lessons of the **same domain reach 3 or more**, the AI autonomously:
>
> 1. Creates a proper project rule file in the **corresponding Blueprint domain folder**
>    e.g., DB & Auth lessons → `engineering/{NNN}_database_auth.md`
>    e.g., Security lessons → `security/{NNN}_security_policy.md`
> 2. Moves the relevant lessons to the new file
> 3. Adds a reference link to this index
>
> **Design Philosophy**: Lessons are Co-located with rules in the same folder. Consolidating everything here is NOT the intent.
> The AI applies this protocol during task work and organizes lessons into domain-specific structures. When judgment is required, the operator decides.
> See `axiarch-rules/{lang}/CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` for details.

## Separated Domain Files

> [!NOTE]
> When 3+ lessons of the same domain accumulate, the AI automatically creates a domain-specific file.
> The link list below is updated automatically.

| # | Domain | File | Count |
|:--|:-------|:-----|:------|
| 1 | Operations | [operations/010_release_upgrade_operations.md](../operations/010_release_upgrade_operations.md) | 12 |

<!-- AUTO-CRYSTALLIZATION: When creating a domain file, add a row to the table above -->
<!-- Example: | 1 | DB & Auth | `engineering/010_database_auth.md` | 3 | -->

## Unsorted Lessons

> [!TIP]
> **Lesson Entry Format**
> When adding a new lesson, use the format below.
> **Always include a `Domain:` tag.** This is the classification key for auto-separation.
>
> ### [YYYY-MM-DD] Lesson Title
> **Domain:** DB & Auth / Security / Architecture / Quality / Design / Operations / Governance / Performance / Other
> **Context:** The situation or background where the problem occurred
> **Problem:** The specific issue or failure
> **Solution/Rule:** The solution, or the rule established to reduce recurrence risk
> **Reference:** Related files or commits (if any)

### [Initial] Project Initialization Lesson
**Domain:** Governance
**Context:** New project or rule system refresh.
**Rule:** Treat `AGENTS.md` and `axiarch-rules` protocols as the highest-priority source of truth.

## Appendix B: Domain File Template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Template Reference**
>
> When creating a new domain lessons file, **MUST** follow the official template in the
> "Crystallized Rule File Template" section of `axiarch-rules/{lang}/CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md`.
>
> The inline template previously listed here has been retired to eliminate structural drift risk.
> **Always treat `CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` as the Single Source of Truth for templates.**

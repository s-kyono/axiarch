# 999. Project Specific Rules Template

> [!TIP]
> Copy this file to the corresponding domain folder in `axiarch-rules/{lang}/blueprint/`. Rename the file according to the folder's internal sequence (e.g., `security/010_security_policy.md`).
> Rules in `universal/` are the "Constitution," while `blueprint/` is the "Laws" — the place to concretize (or exceptionally override) the Constitution for project-specific context.

### Blueprint Folder & File Naming Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Numbers already used in core/**: `998` and `999` are already used by template files (`core/998_feature_spec_template.md`, `core/999_project_specific_template.md`). Other folders may use any available number from `000` to `999`.
> All other numbers (`010`–`997`) are **freely available regardless of purpose**. Both project-specific rules and feature specs use the same sequential numbering within each folder.

| Folder | Available Numbers | Examples |
|:--------|:------------|:------|
| `core/` | 010–997 | Lessons log (`010_`), crystallized rules, project-specific settings |
| `security/` | 010–997 | Security policies, security feature specs |
| `engineering/` | 010–997 | System-specific rules, engineering feature specs |
| `design/` | 010–997 | Design system overrides, design feature specs |
| `quality/` | 010–997 | Test strategy overrides, QA feature specs |
| `operations/` | 010–997 | SRE, CI/CD overrides, operations feature specs |
| `product/` | 010–997 | Business rules, feature specs (most common placement) |
| `ai/` | 010–997 | AI strategy overrides, AI feature specs |

> **Numbering rule**: Within each folder, use `010_`, `020_`, `030_`... in **10-unit increments** (to reserve insertion gaps for future files). Do NOT use global numbering across folders.

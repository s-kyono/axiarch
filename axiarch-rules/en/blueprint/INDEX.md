# 000. Blueprint Index

> [!NOTE]
> **Map to the Brain**:
> This directory is your project's "brain" (specifications and lessons learned).
> `universal/` rules are the **"Constitution"** — immutable principles common to all projects.
> `blueprint/` rules are the **"Laws"** — concrete implementations that customize the Constitution for your project's specific needs.
> Sparse Numbering preserves room for future extension.
> **The initial structure maps to the same 8 folders as `universal/`**. However, Blueprint is the mutable project-specific layer; when a new domain cannot reasonably fit existing folders, a user-approved new folder may be added.

> **Initial Mapping with Universal**: 1:1 mapping with the 8 folders in `universal/` (`core/`, `security/`, `engineering/`, `design/`, `quality/`, `operations/`, `product/`, `ai/`).
> The "Constitution (Universal)" is concretized by "Project-Specific Rules (Blueprint)" at the initial folder-name level. This is the starting structure, and Blueprint may be extended with user approval.

## Operational Guide

### Initial Setup
1. Set `Project Native Language` in `AGENTS.md`
2. Optionally delete the unused language folder (`ja/` or `en/`) only when fixing the project to single-language operation. If both languages are kept, prioritize the folder matching `Project Native Language`
3. Rewrite `core/000_project_overview.md` with your project's content

### Adding Feature Specs (Blueprint First)
1. **Copy `core/998_feature_spec_template.md`**
2. Place it in the relevant domain folder (e.g., `product/020_feature_payment.md` *Note: Use any available number from 000 to 999; there are no domain-specific numbering bands.*)
3. **Write §3 Acceptance Criteria first** — do NOT write code while this section is empty
4. Fill in remaining sections (data model, API design, test strategy, etc.)
5. **Add an entry to the relevant folder section in this INDEX.md**

### Adding Project-Specific Rules
1. Copy `core/999_project_specific_template.md`
2. Place it in the corresponding folder with a number (e.g., `security/010_security_policy.md` *Note: Use any available number from 000 to 999; there are no domain-specific numbering bands.*)
3. Fill each template section with project-specific content
4. **Add an entry to the relevant folder section in this INDEX.md**

### Recording Lessons (Crystallization)
- Append to `core/010_project_lessons_log.md` at task completion or when key decisions are made
- When 3+ lessons of the same domain accumulate, the AI creates a proper rule file in the corresponding existing or user-approved domain folder
- See `axiarch-rules/{lang}/CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` for detailed procedures

# Operations

> This folder is the destination for project-specific rules
> crystallized from `core/010_project_lessons_log.md` for the **Operations domain**.

> [!NOTE]
> Files are automatically generated when lessons accumulated through real-world practice reach the threshold (3 entries), following `CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md`.
> Pre-populating seed files is prohibited as it violates the YAGNI principle. The current file exists because real operations lessons reached the crystallization threshold.

## Operating Guide

- Follow `axiarch-rules/{lang}/CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` for the lesson crystallization process
- File numbering uses 3-digit numbers with any available value from `000` to `999`. Incrementing by 10 is a recommended convention, not a reserved band; `000` may be used when appropriate.
- AI must not autonomously create new domain folders. Prefer existing folders; if a new domain cannot be classified, propose an extension and create it only after user approval.

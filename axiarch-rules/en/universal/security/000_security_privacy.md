## §1. Primary Directive & Golden Rule

### 1.1. Priority Hierarchy

-   **Legal & Security > User Experience > Revenue > DX**:
    -   **Iron Rule**: "Even if the user wants it, do not provide it if there is a legal risk."
    -   **Example**: Even if users want to "view history without logging in," reject it if there is a privacy risk. Even if users want to "pay offline," reject it if there is a security risk.

### 1.2. Assume Breach

-   Design with the assumption that a breach is not "if" but "when."
-   Always prioritize designs that minimize the Blast Radius upon breach.
-   **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later**: Mandate designs that account for the risk of currently encrypted data being decrypted by future quantum computers (see §16.4 PQC).

### 1.3. Defense in Depth

-   Do not rely on a single defense measure. Apply authentication, authorization, encryption, monitoring, and network isolation in layers.
-   Mandate designs where remaining layers function even if one is breached.
-   **Minimum Security Layer Configuration**:

| Layer | Required Measures |
|:------|:-----------------|
| **Network** | WAF + CDN + DDoS mitigation + VPC isolation |
| **Identity** | IDaaS + MFA/Passkey + RBAC/ABAC |
| **Application** | Input validation + CSP + CORS + CSRF defense |
| **Data** | Encryption (at-rest/in-transit) + RLS + masking |
| **Endpoint** | Device posture + SRI + Trusted Types |
| **Monitoring** | SIEM + audit logs + anomaly detection |

### 1.4. Security Champion Culture

-   Security is not solely the responsibility of a specialized team—it is a **fundamental responsibility of all engineers**.
-   "Security can wait" or "we'll handle it after release" is considered a **design defect**.

---

## §2. Zero Trust Architecture

> **Reference**: NIST SP 800-207, CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model v2.0, NIST CSF 2.0

### 2.1. Core Principles

-   **Rule 2.1.1: The Untrusted Default**: Enforce **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Encryption** on **all access subjects**, including internal networks, admin accounts, and AI agents, under the premise of "trust nothing."
-   **Rule 2.1.2: Least Privilege**: Grant only the **minimum permissions** necessary for the purpose. Recommend JIT (Just-In-Time) access.
-   **Rule 2.1.3: Microsegmentation**: Segment networks finely to physically prevent lateral movement upon breach.
-   **Rule 2.1.4: Continuous Verification**: **Force re-authentication** when risk score changes (anomalous IP, geographic shift, device change) are detected, even during active sessions.
-   **Rule 2.1.5: Deny by Default**: Deny all access not explicitly permitted.

### 2.2. CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model v2.0 Compliance

-   **Law**: Use the CISA ZTMM v2.0 five pillars + three cross-cutting capabilities as the reference framework.

| Pillar | Required Measures |
|:-------|:-----------------|
| **1. Identity** | IDaaS required. MFA/Passkey enforced. Phishing-resistant MFA recommended. NHI management (§3) |
| **2. Device** | Prioritize access from managed devices. Device posture verification. EDR/XDR integration recommended |
| **3. Network** | VPC, private subnets required. Public DB prohibited. SASE integration recommended (§13) |
| **4. Application** | Input validation and authorization checks at all endpoints. WAF required. API Gateway (§10) |
| **5. Data** | Encryption at rest and in transit required. Protection based on data classification (§8). DSPM recommended |

| Cross-Cutting Capability | Requirements |
|:------------------------|:------------|
| **Visibility & Analytics** | Integrated log collection and real-time monitoring across all layers. SIEM integration required |
| **Automation & Orchestration** | SOAR integration. Automated security incident response workflows |
| **Governance** | NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function compliance. Risk appetite definition. RACI clarification |

-   **Maturity Stages**: Evaluate the organization's current position across Traditional → Initial → Advanced → Optimal and incrementally improve maturity.

### 2.3. NIST CSF 2.0 Govern Function Integration

-   **Law**: Comply with the newly established "Govern" function in NIST CSF 2.0 and integrate security risk management into enterprise risk management (ERM).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Risk Appetite Definition**: Document acceptable risk levels and reflect in §29 governance framework.
    2.  **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly define security decision-makers, executors, and responsible parties.
    3.  **Supply Chain Risk**: Apply Zero Trust principles to vendors and sub-processors (§27).
    4.  **Shadow AI Management**: Develop policies to detect and govern unauthorized AI tool usage.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §29 (Security Governance)

### 2.4. Identity-First Zero Trust

-   **Law**: The starting point of Zero Trust is **identity**. Design with identity as the new perimeter, not network boundaries.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Start all access requests with identity verification. Zero trust based on network location.
    2.  Manage human IDs, NHIs, and AI agent IDs uniformly (§3).
    3.  Recommend risk-based dynamic authorization (context-aware access).
-   **Cross-Reference**: §3 (Identity-First Security & ITDR)

---

## §3. Identity-First Security & ITDR

> **Reference**: CISA ZTMM Identity Pillar, NIST SP 800-63-4, ISO/IEC 24760

### 3.1. Unified Identity Management Framework

-   **Law**: Manage human IDs, non-human IDs (NHI), and AI agent IDs within a **unified identity fabric**.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **ID Inventory**: Inventory all IDs (user accounts, service accounts, API keys, CI/CD pipelines, AI agents) with clear ownership.
    2.  **ID Lifecycle Management**: Automate provisioning → usage → modification → deactivation → deletion.
    3.  **IAM Platform Integration**: Use IDaaS (Firebase Auth, Auth0, Cognito, etc.) as the sole identity provider. Building custom auth infrastructure is prohibited.
    4.  **Orphaned ID Detection**: Periodically detect departed/unused IDs and automatically deactivate.

### 3.2. Non-Human Identity Management (NHI)

-   **Law**: NHIs outnumber human IDs by **45x+** (industry survey) and are a primary breach vector. Manage NHIs with the same rigor as human IDs.
-   **NHI Classification**:

| NHI Type | Examples | Risk Level |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------|
| **Service Accounts** | GCP Service Account, AWS IAM Role | High |
| **API Keys** | External SaaS integration keys | High |
| **CI/CD Credentials** | GitHub Actions secrets, deploy keys | Critical |
| **AI Agents** | MCP Client, A2A Agent | Critical |
| **Bot/Automation** | Cron jobs, Webhook handlers | Medium |
| **Certificates/Tokens** | mTLS certificates, OAuth client credentials | High |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Owner Assignment**: Assign a human owner to every NHI. NHIs without owners are immediate deactivation candidates.
    2.  **Least Privilege**: Limit scopes granted to NHIs to the minimum necessary. Periodically audit NHIs with broad permissions (`admin`, `*`).
    3.  **Short-Lived Credentials**: Prefer **dynamic, short-lived secrets** over static keys (§21.3).
    4.  **Rotation Enforcement**: Apply **shorter rotation cycles** for NHI secrets than for human ones (§21.5).
    5.  **Usage Pattern Monitoring**: Baseline normal NHI usage patterns and detect anomalies immediately.
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Sharing service accounts and reusing the same credentials across multiple services.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §21 (Secrets Management), §18 (Agentic AI)

### 3.3. Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR)

-   **Law**: Detect and auto-respond to identity-related attacks (Credential Stuffing, Account Takeover, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement) in real-time.
-   **Detection Patterns**:

| Threat Pattern | Detection Method | Auto-Response |
|:-------------|:----------------|:-------------|
| **Credential Stuffing** | Multiple account auth failures from same IP | Temp IP block + CAPTCHA enforcement |
| **Account Takeover (ATO)** | Anomalous geographic login, device change | Session invalidation + re-auth required |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Unusual role change patterns | Change blocked + admin alert |
| **Lateral Movement** | Sequential access to multiple services | Session isolation + investigation start |
| **Golden/Silver Ticket** | Kerberos anomalies | All sessions invalidated |
| **MFA Fatigue Attack** | Many MFA push requests in short time | MFA push paused + notification |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Behavioral Baseline**: Build normal behavior profiles per user/NHI. Reflect deviations in risk score.
    2.  **Real-Time Risk Scoring**: Calculate risk score per login attempt. Escalate defenses on threshold breach (CAPTCHA → MFA → Block).
    3.  **SIEM/XDR Integration**: Send ITDR detection events to SIEM/XDR for correlation analysis.
    4.  **Auto-Remediation**: Build automated response workflows (SOAR integration) for high-risk events.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §6 (Session Management), §26 (Security Observability)

### 3.4. Privileged Access Management (PAM)

-   **Law**: Privileged accounts (admins, DBAs, infra managers) are the **highest-value attack targets**. Manage privileged access rigorously.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **JIT (Just-In-Time) Access**: Grant privileges temporarily when needed, automatically revoke after task completion.
    2.  **JEA (Just Enough Administration)**: Limit privilege scope to the minimum necessary. Prohibit permanent full-admin access.
    3.  **Privileged Session Recording**: Record all operations in privileged sessions for post-audit.
    4.  **Break Glass Procedure**: Pre-define emergency privileged access procedures. Audit and report immediately after use.
    5.  **Standing Privilege Zero Goal**: Set a long-term goal to approach zero standing privileged accounts.

### 3.5. ID Federation & SSO

-   **Law**: Unify identity management across multiple services to prevent password proliferation.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **SSO Required**: Use SSO (SAML 2.0 / OIDC) for unified authentication of internal tools and admin consoles. Individual authentication is deprecated.
    2.  **SCIM**: Automate user provisioning/deprovisioning.
    3.  **Conditional Access**: Dynamic access control based on device posture, network location, and risk score.

---

## §4. Authentication & Authorization Architecture

### 4.1. Credential Hygiene

-   **Physically prohibit** writing API keys, secrets, and DB connection strings in source code. Always use `process.env`.
-   Use encrypted channels like 1Password for sharing sensitive information. **Slack pasting prohibited**.
-   **CI Gate**: Integrate `git-secrets` / `gitleaks` into pre-commit hooks to physically prevent secret commits.

```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED: Hardcoded secrets
const supabase = createClient(
  'https://xxx.supabase.co',
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'
);

// ✅ CORRECT: Via environment variables
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
```

### 4.2. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

-   **MFA enforced** on admin accounts. No exceptions.
-   **Passkey/FIDO2/WebAuthn recommended**: Adopt phishing-resistant auth methods as the **top priority** (detailed in §5).
-   **SMS OTP deprecated**: Due to SIM swap attacks and SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SMS OTP is **insufficient as the sole second factor for high-risk operations**. Prefer TOTP/Passkey/hardware keys.
-   **MFA Fatigue countermeasures**: Detect and auto-block rapid bulk push notifications + user notification. Number Matching recommended.

### 4.3. IDaaS Required

-   Building custom auth infrastructure is prohibited. Use verified solutions such as Firebase Auth, Auth0, Cognito.
-   **Rationale**: Auth is an extremely high-risk foundation where "one mistake puts all users at risk." Custom implementations invite inadequate password hashing, timing attacks, session management flaws, etc.

### 4.4. Social Login Security Protocol

-   **Authorization Code Flow + PKCE required**: Implicit Flow prohibited.
-   **CSRF Prevention**: `state` parameter required.
-   **Server-Side Token Exchange**: `client_secret` used server-side only.
-   **Scope Minimization**: Limit to `openid`, `email`, `profile`, etc.
-   **Explicit Account Link**: Prohibit automatic linking to existing accounts with the same email. Display confirmation UI.
-   **Session Verification**: Verify all `iss`, `aud`, `exp` fields.

### 4.5. RBAC / ABAC Design

-   **Admin Privilege Verification (SSOT)**: The `role` column in `public.profiles` table is the sole source of truth. Dependence on frontend flags or legacy tables is a **security hole**.
-   **The Guardian Protocol (Centralized Auth)**: Prohibit scattered auth check logic. Use centralized guard functions (e.g., `admin-guard.ts`).

```typescript
// ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Individual role checks in each file
const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('role').eq('id', userId);
if (data?.role !== 'admin') throw new Error('Unauthorized');

// ✅ CORRECT: Centralized guard function
import { requireAdmin } from '@/lib/auth/admin-guard';
const user = await requireAdmin(); // Internally performs auth + authz + audit log
```

-   **Role Enumeration Symmetry**: Multiple guard functions validating the same domain must retrieve role lists from a **common constant array**.
-   **Unconditional Baseline Auth**: Handlers in action layers using privileged clients must **execute auth/authz checks on all code paths** regardless of data status.
-   **ABAC recommended**: When simple RBAC is insufficient (multi-tenant, fine-grained access control), adopt Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

### 4.6. RBAC Defense Protocol

-   All Admin API/Actions must enforce RBAC check at the beginning.
-   Financial, permission, and delete operations require Turnstile/OTP additional auth beyond RBAC.
-   Record all Admin operations in audit logs. Include before/after diffs for destructive operations.

### 4.7. Omnichannel Auth

-   Support both web cookies and **Bearer Token (JWT)**. Skipping verification in Server Actions is prohibited.

### 4.8. API Key Security

-   **Hashing Mandate**: API Keys must **never be stored in plaintext**. Hash with SHA-256 or equivalent.
-   **Dual Auth Protocol**: Implement as OR condition of `X-API-KEY` and `Authorization: Bearer`.
-   **Prefix Design**: Add prefixes (e.g., `sk_live_`, `pk_test_`) to API Keys for type/environment identification.

### 4.9. Password Policy

-   **Law**: Password policies must comply with NIST SP 800-63B / 800-63-4.
-   **Requirements**:
    -   **Minimum length**: 8+ characters (admins: 12+).
    -   **No complexity rules enforced**: Per NIST SP 800-63B, **do not recommend** mandatory uppercase/symbol requirements.
    -   **Breached password check**: Check against **Have I Been Pwned API** on new set/change.
    -   **No forced periodic changes**: Per NIST recommendation, **do not force** regular password changes (except on confirmed breach).
    -   **Password strength meter**: Provide real-time strength feedback (e.g., zxcvbn library).
    -   **Password hashing**: Use **Argon2id** (recommended) or **bcrypt** (cost ≥ 12). SHA-256/MD5 storage is absolutely prohibited.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §16.2 (Recommended Algorithms), §4.2 (MFA)

### 4.10. OAuth 2.1 & DPoP Hardening Protocol ★NEW

> **Reference**: OAuth 2.1 (IETF draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1), RFC 9449 (DPoP), RFC 9396 (RAR), RFC 9126 (PAR)

-   **Law**: Align OAuth 2.0 implementations with OAuth 2.1 hardening requirements and adopt Sender-Constrained Token strategies against token theft and replay attacks.
-   **OAuth 2.1 Required Changes**:

| Change | OAuth 2.0 | OAuth 2.1 | Action Required |
|:------|:---------|:---------|:----------------|
| **PKCE** | Recommended (public clients) | **Mandatory for all clients** | Enforce `code_challenge_method=S256` |
| **Implicit Flow** | Permitted | **Completely prohibited** | Migrate existing implementations to Authorization Code + PKCE |
| **Resource Owner Password Credentials** | Permitted | **Completely prohibited** | Deprecate and remove |
| **Refresh Token Rotation** | Optional | **Mandatory for public clients** | Issue new Refresh Token and invalidate old one on refresh |
| **Redirect URI** | Partial match permitted | **Exact match only** | Implement Exact Match validation |

-   **DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession) — RFC 9449**:
    -   **Overview**: Cryptographically bind access tokens to the client's public key to prevent re-use on token theft. Addresses a critical weakness of Bearer Tokens.
    -   **Action**:
        1.  **DPoP Proof Generation**: Client attaches a DPoP JWT signed with a key pair (`ES256`/`EdDSA` recommended) to the `DPoP` header per request.
        2.  **Server-Side Validation**: Validate `htm` (HTTP method), `htu` (HTTP URI), `iat` (issuance time), `jti` (Nonce, replay prevention) of the DPoP JWT.
        3.  **Nonce Enforcement**: Server issues `DPoP-Nonce` and requires client to include it, blocking replay attacks.

```typescript
// ✅ DPoP Proof generation example (client-side)
import { generateKeyPair, exportJWK, SignJWT } from 'jose';

async function createDPoPProof(
  method: string,
  url: string,
  nonce?: string
): Promise<string> {
  const { privateKey, publicKey } = await generateKeyPair('ES256');
  const jwk = await exportJWK(publicKey);
  
  return new SignJWT({
    htm: method,          // HTTP method
    htu: url,            // HTTP URI (without query/fragment)
    jti: crypto.randomUUID(), // Unique ID (replay prevention)
    ...(nonce ? { nonce } : {}),
  })
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'ES256', typ: 'dpop+jwt', jwk })
    .setIssuedAt()
    .sign(privateKey);
}
```

-   **PAR (Pushed Authorization Requests) — RFC 9126**:
    -   Pre-send authorization request parameters via back-channel (server-to-server) rather than front-channel (browser). Recommended for high-risk systems (finance, healthcare).
-   **RAR (Rich Authorization Requests) — RFC 9396**:
    -   Specify fine-grained authorization details via `authorization_details` parameter. Required for Open Banking / FAPI 2.0 compliance.
-   **mTLS Certificate-Bound Access Tokens — RFC 8705**:
    -   **Overview**: Cryptographically binds access tokens to the client certificate's Thumbprint. Achieves a stronger certificate-based Sender-Constraint than DPoP.
    -   **Use Cases**: Financial APIs (FAPI 2.0), machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Actively recommended where client certificates are available.
    -   **Action**: Validate the `cnf.x5t#S256` claim server-side and confirm it matches the Thumbprint of the received certificate.

```typescript
// ✅ mTLS Thumbprint validation (server-side)
import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';

function verifyMtlsBinding(token: JWTPayload, clientCertDer: Buffer): boolean {
  const thumbprint = createHash('sha256').update(clientCertDer).digest('base64url');
  return token.cnf?.['x5t#S256'] === thumbprint;
}
```

---

## §5. Passkey & Passwordless Strategy

> **Reference**: FIDO Alliance, W3C WebAuthn Level 3, NIST SP 800-63B Supplement

### 5.1. Strategic Direction

-   **Law**: Position Passkey (FIDO2/WebAuthn) as the strategic direction for passwordless authentication and develop a phased migration plan.
-   **Background**: As of 2025, 15+ billion online accounts support Passkeys. 87% of enterprises are advancing Passkey adoption (FIDO Alliance survey).

### 5.2. Passkey Classification

| Type | Characteristics | Use Case |
|:-----|:---------------|:---------|
| **Synced Passkey** | Cloud-synced (iCloud Keychain/Google, etc.). Cross-device capable | General users. Convenience-focused |
| **Device-Bound Passkey** | Fixed to specific device/hardware key. No sync | Admins, high-risk operations. Security-focused |

### 5.3. Phased Rollout Roadmap

| Phase | Action | Target |
|:------|:-------|:-------|
| **Phase 1** | Offer Passkey registration as optional | Awareness building |
| **Phase 2** | Password + Passkey coexistence. Passkey-recommended UI | 30%+ adoption |
| **Phase 3** | Passkey-first. Password as fallback | 70%+ adoption |
| **Phase 4** | Full passwordless migration (Passkey-only) | Long-term goal |

### 5.4. Account Recovery

-   **Law**: Provide multiple recovery methods for Passkey loss.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Backup Passkeys**: Recommend users register multiple Passkeys (device + cloud sync).
    2.  **Recovery Codes**: Provide one-time recovery codes (offline storage recommended).
    3.  **Staged Recovery**: Multi-step process of email/SMS + identity verification + waiting period.
    4.  **Maintain Phishing Resistance**: Design password reset fallbacks that do not compromise phishing resistance.

### 5.5. Admin Account Passkey Requirements

-   **Device-Bound Passkey required**: Hardware keys like YubiKey are **mandatory** for admin accounts.
-   Admin authentication with Synced Passkey only is **not permitted**.

### 5.6. UX Design Principles

-   **Plain language**: Use user-friendly expressions like "Sign in with Face ID/fingerprint." Avoid technical terms (WebAuthn, FIDO2) in UI.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Guarantee Passkey compatibility across all major platforms (iOS/Android/Windows/macOS/Linux + major browsers).
-   **Conditional UI**: Recommend Passkey autofill via WebAuthn Conditional Mediation (`mediation: 'conditional'`).
-   **Cross-Reference**: §4.2 (MFA), §29 (Security Governance)

---

## §6. Session Management & Account Protection

### 6.1. Token Expiration Design

| Token Type | Recommended TTL | Admin Console |
|:-----------|:---------------|:-------------|
| **Access Token** | ≤ 1 hour | ≤ 15 min |
| **Refresh Token** | 7–30 days | ≤ 7 days |
| **Session Cookie** | Browser session | Browser session |
| **Signed URL** | ≤ 5 min | ≤ 5 min |

### 6.2. Step-Up Authentication

-   Require **re-authentication (Step-Up Auth)** for high-risk operations (password change, payment, email change), even with a valid session.
-   **Tiered Security Protocol**:

| Tier | Operation Examples | Required Auth |
|:-----|:------------------|:-------------|
| **Tier 1: View** | Data reference | Standard auth |
| **Tier 2: Modify** | Profile update | Standard auth + RBAC |
| **Tier 3: Financial/Permission** | Payment, role change | RBAC + Turnstile + OTP |
| **Tier 4: Destructive** | Account deletion, full data purge | RBAC + OTP + admin approval |

### 6.3. Concurrent Session Policy

-   Set upper limits on simultaneous login devices. Invalidate oldest session on excess.
-   Apply stricter limits for admin accounts (1–2 concurrent sessions).
-   Recommend providing "Sign out of all devices" functionality.

### 6.4. Suspicious Session Detection

-   Detect and notify users of simultaneous access from different IPs/geographically distant regions to the same account.
-   **Impossible Travel Detection**: Auto-detect physically impossible travel speed (e.g., New York → London in 5 minutes).
-   **Cross-Reference**: §3.3 (ITDR)

### 6.5. Server-Side Invalidation

-   Immediately invalidate server-side on logout. Client-side token deletion alone is insufficient.
-   Immediately invalidate all sessions on account suspension/deletion.
-   **Token Revocation List**: Maintain a list of invalidated tokens and check during validation.

### 6.6. Account Lockout & Brute Force Prevention

-   **Law**: Apply progressive lockout against repeated authentication failures to structurally prevent brute force attacks.

| Failure Count | Action |
|:-------------|:-------|
| 3 | Require CAPTCHA (Turnstile) |
| 5 | **15-minute lock** + email notification |
| 10 | **1-hour lock** + admin alert |
| 20 | **Account frozen** + manual admin unlock required |

-   **IP-Based Limiting**: Detect/block repeated failures from the same IP to different accounts (Credential Stuffing).
-   **Constant-Time Comparison**: Keep response time constant on auth failure to prevent **timing attacks**.
-   **Error Messages**: Return unified messages like "Email or password is incorrect" that don't reveal which is wrong.

### 6.7. The Secret Rotation Lifecycle

-   Rotate IAM credentials and JWT signing keys every **90 days**.
-   **Panic Button (Kill Switch)**: Maintain up-to-date procedures for bulk session invalidation upon leakage.

### 6.8. The Physical Master Key (Bus Factor Defense)

-   Record critically important recovery information on **physical media (paper)** and store in a fire-resistant safe.
-   **Scope**: `service_role` key, Cloudflare Recovery Code, domain lock code, 1Password master key.

### 6.9. Digital Legacy Protocol

-   **Law**: Document data handling policy for long-term user inactivity in the Terms of Service.
-   "1 year no login" → notification → "3 years no login" → account deactivation + PII anonymization (per §9.3).

---

## §7. Privacy by Design

> **Reference**: ISO 31700, GDPR Art.25, Global Privacy Laws, CCPA/CPRA

### 7.1. Seven Principles

-   **Law**: Embed Ann Cavoukian's 7 Privacy by Design principles from the design phase.

| # | Principle | Implementation Obligation |
|:--|:---------|:------------------------|
| 1 | Proactive not Reactive | Identify privacy risks proactively in design reviews |
| 2 | Privacy as Default | Opt-in data collection. Minimize collection scope by default |
| 3 | Embedded into Design | Conduct PIA (Privacy Impact Assessment) during design phase |
| 4 | Positive-Sum | Design for the coexistence of privacy and functionality |
| 5 | End-to-End Lifecycle | Protect across all stages: collection → storage → use → disposal |
| 6 | Transparency | Clearly state usage purposes, retention periods, third-party sharing in privacy policies |
| 7 | User-Centric | Provide UI for users to manage and delete their own data |

### 7.2. Data Minimization

-   **Law**: Structurally prohibit collection of unnecessary or excessive data.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Define "collection purpose," "legal basis," "retention period" for each data item (Data Catalog obligation).
    2.  `SELECT *` prohibited. Explicitly retrieve only needed columns.
    3.  Use DTO patterns to avoid exposing internal structures externally.
    4.  Auto-delete data after retention period expiration (TTL design).

### 7.3. PII Sensitivity Classification

| Sensitivity | Data Examples | Protection Requirements |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------------------|
| **Critical** | Password hashes, credit card numbers | Strong encryption + access logs + 2+ person approval |
| **High** | Name, email, phone, date of birth | Encryption + RLS + view logs |
| **Medium** | Address, nickname | RLS + least privilege access |
| **Low** | Settings, UI preferences | Standard access controls |

### 7.4. PII Masking

-   **Law**: **Never include** PII in log output, error reports, or support screens.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Embed PII filters in logging frameworks to auto-mask `email`, `phone`, `name`, etc.
    2.  Prohibit raw object log output like `console.log(user)`.
    3.  Configure PII filters in error tracking tools (Sentry, etc.).

```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED: Log output containing PII
console.log('User login:', { email: user.email, name: user.name });

// ✅ CORRECT: PII masked
console.log('User login:', { userId: user.id, role: user.role });
```

### 7.5. Encryption Requirements

| State | Minimum Requirement |
|:------|:-------------------|
| **At Rest** | AES-256 (DB/Storage/Backup all) |
| **In Transit** | TLS 1.2+ (TLS 1.3 recommended) |
| **In Use** | Memory encryption recommended (Confidential Computing) |

-   **Cross-Reference**: §16 (Cryptographic Policy & PQC)

### 7.6. Data Residency

-   **Law**: Be aware of data storage locations (Country/Region) and comply with jurisdictional requirements.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Identify applicable data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, Global Privacy Laws, etc.) for service regions.
    2.  Place DB regions in the same or legally permissible regions as service delivery.
    3.  Apply legal frameworks (SCC/IDTA, etc.) for cross-border data transfers.

---

## §8. Data Classification & DSPM

### 8.1. Data Classification Framework

-   **Law**: Systematically classify all data assets and auto-apply protection levels based on classification.

| Classification | Description | Protection Requirements | Examples |
|:-------------|:-----------|:-----------------------|:---------|
| **Restricted** | Legal sanctions/major damage on leak | Encryption+RLS+audit logs+DLP | PII, PHI, payment data |
| **Confidential** | Business confidential | Encryption+RLS+access logs | Internal docs, customer lists |
| **Internal** | Internal-facing information | RBAC+access control | Internal wiki, design docs |
| **Public** | Public information | Tamper prevention only | Public pages, press releases |

### 8.2. DSPM (Data Security Posture Management)

-   **Law**: Continuously discover, assess, and improve data security posture across cloud environments.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Shadow Data Discovery**: Auto-discover unmanaged data in managed services, logs, and backups.
    2.  **Data Flow Tracking**: Visualize where sensitive data flows and who accesses it.
    3.  **Excessive Access Detection**: Detect gaps between actual access patterns and granted permissions; recommend permission reduction.
    4.  **Compliance Posture Assessment**: Score current compliance status against GDPR/CCPA/Global Privacy Laws requirements.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §7.3 (PII Sensitivity Classification), §29 (Security Governance)

### 8.3. Data Lineage & Catalog

-   **Law**: Make it traceable "where data comes from, where it flows, and who touches it" for sensitive data.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Manage table/column-level metadata (classification level, owner, retention period) with data catalog tools.
    2.  Auto-propagate classification labels during ETL/ELT pipeline data movement.
    3.  **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Detect and block unauthorized copying, downloading, or external transmission of Restricted-classified data.

## §9. Consent Management & Data Subject Rights

### 9.1. Legal Compliance Matrix

| Law | Region | Consent Requirements | Deletion Right | Notification Period |
|:----|:-------|:--------------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| **GDPR** | EU/EEA | Explicit opt-in | Yes (Right to be Forgotten) | Within 72 hours |
| **Global Privacy Laws** | Japan | Purpose publication/notification | Yes (Disclosure/Correction/Cessation) | Promptly |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | California | Opt-out right | Yes (Deletion right) | Within 45 days |
| **LGPD** | Brazil | Explicit consent | Yes | Reasonable period |
| **PIPA** | South Korea | Explicit consent | Yes | Without delay |

### 9.2. Consent Management Platform (CMP)

-   **Law**: Obtain user consent before initiating cookies/tracking technologies. "Default consent" is prohibited.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Implement CMP (e.g., OneTrust, Cookiebot, Osano) to automate consent acquisition, recording, and changes.
    2.  Clearly categorize consent (essential/functional/analytics/marketing).
    3.  Ensure basic service functionality is available even when consent is refused (no consent coercion).
    4.  Retain consent records as legal evidence for **at least 5 years**.

### 9.3. Right to be Forgotten

-   **Law**: Build mechanisms to structurally and completely respond to user deletion requests.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Physical Deletion**: PII-containing records must be **physically deleted**, not logically deleted.
    2.  **Cascade Consideration**: Remove PII from related tables, storage, backups, and CDN caches.
    3.  **PII in Backups**: When individual record deletion from backups is technically infeasible, use Cryptographic Erasure (destroy encryption keys).
    4.  **Response Deadline**: GDPR=30 days, CCPA=45 days. Implement timer-based auto-reminders.
    5.  **Deletion Proof**: Record deletion completion (target data scope, deletion timestamp, executor) in audit logs.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/100_data_governance.md`

### 9.4. Data Portability

-   **Law**: Provide functionality for users to export their data in structured, machine-readable format (JSON/CSV).
-   **Action**: Apply rate limiting and authentication (Step-Up Auth) to export functionality. Async processing for bulk exports.

### 9.5. Dark Pattern Prohibition

> **Reference**: EU DSA Art.25, GDPR EDPB Guidelines 03/2022, FTC Dark Patterns Report 2022, ACM CHI Standards

-   **Law**: Designing dark patterns that guide or deceive users in consent acquisition UIs and privacy settings is **strictly prohibited**.

#### 9.5.1. Prohibited Dark Patterns

| Dark Pattern | Description | Example |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| **Confirmshaming** | Framing the decline option with embarrassing wording | "No thanks, I don't want to save money" |
| **Hidden Default Consent** | Consent is enabled by default | All categories pre-ticked in a cookie banner |
| **Visual Misdirection** | Emphasizing the consent button while hiding the decline option | "Accept All" is a large colored button, "Decline" is a tiny text link |
| **Forced Action** | Requiring consent to access necessary service features | "You must agree to marketing to register" |
| **Nagging** | Repeatedly asking for consent | Showing the consent popup on every login even after declining |
| **Roach Motel** | Easy to consent, hard to revoke | One-click consent, but revocation is hidden deep in settings |
| **Trick Questions** | Confusing users with complex double negatives | "Uncheck this box if you do not want to stop receiving emails" |
| **Privacy Zuckering** | Tricking users into sharing more data than intended | Defaulting to "Public to everyone" settings |

#### 9.5.2. Consent UI Best Practices

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Balanced consent banner implementation
// - Accept/Decline buttons provided with equal visual weight
// - "Manage Settings" link always visible
// - Basic services available even if declined

const ConsentBanner = () => (
  <div className="consent-banner">
    <p>We use cookies to improve our services.</p>
    <div className="consent-actions">
      {/* ✅ Equal styling applied */}
      <button className="btn-primary" onClick={acceptAll}>Accept All</button>
      <button className="btn-secondary" onClick={rejectNonEssential}>Essential Only</button>
      <button className="btn-text" onClick={openSettings}>Manage Settings</button>
    </div>
  </div>
);

// ❌ PROHIBITED: Dark pattern implementation
const BadConsentBanner = () => (
  <div className="consent-banner">
    <button className="btn-giant-green" onClick={acceptAll}>Yes, Accept All!</button>
    {/* ↑ Large prominent "Accept" button */}
    <span className="tiny-grey-text" onClick={reject}>No thanks</span>
    {/* ↑ Inconspicuous "Decline" text */}
  </div>
);
```

#### 9.5.3. Regulatory Obligations

-   **EU DSA Art.25 (Effective Feb 2024)**: VLOPs (Very Large Online Platforms) are explicitly prohibited from using dark patterns to guide users. Violations face fines up to **6%** of global turnover.
-   **GDPR EDPB Guidelines 03/2022**: Specific guidance on dark patterns in cookie consent banners. Mandates that the decline option must be "as easy as" the accept option.
-   **US FTC**: Increased enforcement against dark patterns as unfair or deceptive acts (FTC Act Section 5).

#### 9.5.4. Consent UI Review Checklist

-   `[ ]` Do the accept and decline buttons have equal visual weight?
-   `[ ]` Are basic services available even if non-essential tracking is declined?
-   `[ ]` Is withdrawing consent as easy (e.g., one-click) as giving it?
-   `[ ]` Are question texts clear and free of complex negative phrasing?
-   `[ ]` Is default consent set to "off" for non-essential cookies?
-   `[ ]` Are repeated consent prompts limited? (Recommended max once per 30 days for the same user)

## §10. API Security

> **Reference**: OWASP API Security Top 10 2023, OWASP Top 10 2025

### 10.1. BOLA / BFLA Defense (OWASP API #1 / #5)

-   **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) — API #1**:
    -   **Law**: Mandate object-level authorization checks at all API endpoints.
    -   **Action**: Verify that the requester has access rights to the resource at all endpoints receiving external IDs like `GET /api/users/{id}`.
    -   **Supabase**: Enforce `auth.uid() = user_id` constraints via RLS policies (§24.3).

-   **BFLA (Broken Function Level Authorization) — API #5**:
    -   **Law**: Clearly separate admin and general user API endpoints with role-based access control.
    -   **Anti-Pattern**: Distinguishing admin/general only by URL path (`/admin/users` vs `/users`) without backend authorization checks.

### 10.2. Mass Assignment Defense (API #3)

-   **Law**: Prohibit directly binding client input to models.
-   **Action**: Explicitly define accepted fields via whitelist using DTO patterns.
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Bulk assignment like `Object.assign(model, req.body)`.

### 10.3. Input Validation

-   **Validation at the Edge**: Treat all input as "untrusted data" and validate server-side. Client-side validation alone is insufficient.
-   **Zod / Valibot / ArkType required**: Mandate schema-based validation. Accepting input with `any` type is prohibited.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Strict input validation with Zod
import { z } from 'zod';

const UpdateProfileSchema = z.object({
  nickname: z.string().min(1).max(50).trim(),
  bio: z.string().max(500).optional(),
  // role: z.enum(['admin', 'user']),  ← ❌ Cannot change role via user input
});

export async function updateProfile(input: unknown) {
  const validated = UpdateProfileSchema.parse(input);
  // Use only validated data for DB update
}
```

### 10.4. SQL Injection Defense

-   **Parameterized Query Only**: String concatenation for SQL construction is **absolutely prohibited**. Use ORM or parameterized queries only.
-   **Safe ORM Usage**: Even with ORMs like Prisma or Drizzle, enforce parameterization when using raw SQL features like `$queryRaw`.

### 10.5. SSRF Defense

-   **Law**: When fetching external resources server-side, structurally prohibit access to internal networks (`127.0.0.1`, `10.x`, `172.16.x`, `169.254.169.254`).
-   **Action**: URL whitelist + DNS rebinding countermeasures + firewall blocking metadata service access.

### 10.6. Rate Limiting / Throttling

-   **Law**: Apply rate limiting to all API endpoints.
-   **Recommended Limits**:

| Endpoint Type | Limit (Example) |
|:-------------|:---------------|
| Auth (login/registration) | 5/min/IP |
| General API | 60/min/user |
| Search/heavy processing | 10/min/user |
| Admin API | 30/min/user |
| Webhook reception | 100/min/source |

-   **Rate Limit Headers**: Include `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `Retry-After` in responses.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §23 (Bot Management)

### 10.7. CORS Design

-   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is **absolutely prohibited in production**.
-   **Explicit Domain Specification**: Whitelist approach allowing only trusted origins.
-   Leverage the restriction that `*` cannot be used with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.

### 10.8. CSRF Defense

-   **SameSite Cookie**: Set `SameSite=Lax` (recommended) or `SameSite=Strict` on all cookies.
-   **Double Submit Cookie**: Enable framework CSRF token mechanisms.
-   **Custom Header Check**: Add custom headers like `X-Requested-With` to AJAX requests.

### 10.9. Error Handling

-   **Absolutely prohibit** returning error responses containing stack traces, internal paths, or DB structures in production.
-   Return generic messages to users (`500: Internal Server Error`); record details in server-side logs only.

### 10.10. API Shadow/Zombie Detection

-   **Law**: Periodically detect and retire undocumented APIs (Shadow API) and deprecated-but-still-running APIs (Zombie API).
-   **Action**: Detect unregistered endpoints via API gateway traffic analysis. Cross-reference with API inventory.

### 10.11. API Gateway

-   **Law**: Route all API traffic through API Gateway for centralized authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and logging.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §13 (SASE), §26 (Security Observability)

### 10.12. WebSocket Security ★NEW

-   **Law**: WebSocket connections have a different lifecycle from HTTP requests but are exposed to equivalent security threats. Enforce security at both the connection establishment phase and the message processing phase.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Origin Verification**: Validate the `Origin` header against a whitelist during the WebSocket handshake. Prohibit connections from arbitrary origins.
    2.  **Authentication**: Require authentication via HTTP session cookies or tokens at connection establishment. Continue token validation on post-Upgrade messages.
    3.  **Input Validation**: Validate data received via WebSocket server-side as well (Zod schemas, etc.). Receive as `unknown` and parse explicitly.
    4.  **Rate Limiting**: Impose limits on both connection count and message frequency. Cap the maximum simultaneous connections per client (e.g., 5 connections).
    5.  **Timeout**: Set an idle-connection timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) to prevent resource exhaustion from orphaned sessions.
    6.  **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 DoS**: Configure simultaneous-stream limits and reset-frequency limits at the WAF/CDN layer against CVE-2023-44487 (Rapid Reset) and successor attack patterns.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: WebSocket connection auth and input validation
import { z } from 'zod';

const MessageSchema = z.object({
  type: z.enum(['chat', 'ping']),
  payload: z.string().max(1000),
});

wss.on('connection', (ws, req) => {
  // Auth at connection time
  const token = extractTokenFromRequest(req);
  const user = verifyJWT(token);
  if (!user) { ws.close(4001, 'Unauthorized'); return; }

  ws.on('message', (raw) => {
    // Input validation
    const parsed = MessageSchema.safeParse(JSON.parse(raw.toString()));
    if (!parsed.success) { ws.close(4400, 'Invalid message'); return; }
    // ... processing
  });

  // Idle timeout (5 minutes)
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => ws.close(1000, 'Idle timeout'), 5 * 60_000);
  ws.on('message', () => timeout.refresh());
  ws.on('close', () => clearTimeout(timeout));
});
```

-   **Cross-Reference**: §10.6 (Rate Limiting), §23.3 (DDoS Defense)

### 10.13. HTTP/3 & QUIC Security ★NEW

-   **Law**: HTTP/3 (HTTP over the QUIC protocol) operates on UDP and embeds TLS 1.3, but has different security characteristics and attack surfaces than HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The following must be observed when CDNs or frontend servers enable HTTP/3.
-   **QUIC-Specific Threat Model**:

| Threat | Description | Countermeasure |
|:-------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **0-RTT Replay Attack** | Attacker duplicates and replays 0-RTT early data | Allow 0-RTT only for idempotent GETs. Prohibit 0-RTT for side-effecting operations (POST, payments, etc.) |
| **Session Migration Abuse** | Use QUIC Connection ID changes to evade tracking or port-scan | Enforce cryptographic randomness in Connection ID generation. Monitor NAT Traversal behavior |
| **Amplification Attack** | Send Initial Packet with spoofed source IP to direct server response at target | Mandatory address validation token (Retry Token) per RFC 9000 Section 8.1 |
| **Missing Path Validation** | Forwarding packets to a new path enables DoS | Properly implement PATH_CHALLENGE-based path validation |
| **QPACK Header Injection** | Poison dynamic table to leak information | Apply strict validation of QUIC headers |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **TLS 1.3 exclusive**: QUIC only supports TLS 1.3 (1.2/1.1 are unavailable). Leverage this as an advantage; do not allow old TLS to persist.
    2.  **0-RTT restriction**: Prohibit 0-RTT (`Early-Data`) for requests with side effects (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, payment APIs). Detect `Early-Data` header on the server side and reject non-idempotent operations.
    3.  **Alt-Svc monitoring**: Confirm that `Alt-Svc: h3=":443"` response headers are sent from legitimate servers. Prevent `Alt-Svc` substitution by man-in-the-middle (QUIC Downgrade attacks) in combination with HSTS.
    4.  **WAF update verification**: Verify that WAF can inspect and filter QUIC traffic. Fall back HTTP/3 non-compliant WAFs to HTTP/1.1/2.
    5.  **Address validation**: Enable Retry Token to enforce source IP verification of Initial Packets (amplification attack prevention).

```nginx
# Nginx QUIC (HTTP/3) secure configuration example
http {
  server {
    listen 443 quic reuseport;  # HTTP/3
    listen 443 ssl;             # HTTP/1.1 / HTTP/2 fallback

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;      # QUIC: TLS 1.3 only
    quic_retry on;              # Enable Retry Token (amplification attack prevention)
    http3_max_concurrent_streams 100; # Stream count limit

    # Allow 0-RTT only for idempotent requests
    add_header Alt-Svc 'h3=":443"; ma=86400';

    # Early-Data header check (0-RTT replay prevention)
    if ($http_early_data = "1") {
      # Reject POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE over 0-RTT
      set $early_data_unsafe 1;
    }
  }
}
```

## §11. Supply Chain Security

> **Reference**: NIST SSDF (SP 800-218), SLSA v1.0, OWASP Top 10 2025 A03

### 11.1. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

-   **Law**: Auto-generate and manage SBOMs (CycloneDX/SPDX) for all projects.
-   **Action**: Integrate SBOM generation step into CI/CD pipelines, generating signed SBOMs per build.
-   **Compliance**: Proactively address EU CRA 2027 mandate.

### 11.2. Dependency Scanning

-   **Law**: Continuously scan vulnerabilities in all dependencies (direct and transitive).
-   **Action**:
    1.  Force `npm audit` / `yarn audit` in CI/CD. Critical/High are **merge blockers**.
    2.  Auto-update PRs via Dependabot / Renovate / Snyk.
    3.  **Lockfile Integrity Verification**: Detect tampering in `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock`.
    4.  **Phantom Dependency Detection**: Detect implicit dependencies on undeclared packages.

### 11.3. SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

-   **Target**: Minimum SLSA Level 2. Level 3 recommended.

| SLSA Level | Requirements | Implementation |
|:----------|:------------|:--------------|
| **Level 1** | Build process documentation | Build script version control |
| **Level 2** | Build reproducibility + Provenance generation | Automated CI/CD builds + signed Provenance |
| **Level 3** | Hardened build environment | Ephemeral runners + build isolation |

### 11.4. License Compliance

-   **Prohibited Licenses**: AGPL, SSPL, proprietary restrictive licenses.
-   **Caution Licenses**: GPL (copyleft concerns), CC-BY-NC (no commercial use).
-   **Permitted Licenses**: MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, ISC, MPL 2.0.
-   **Action**: Introduce license checker in CI to block prohibited license dependency additions.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/200_oss_compliance.md`

### 11.5. Typosquatting & Dependency Confusion

-   **Law**: Defend against typosquatting (fake package) attacks on dependencies.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Manually review package name accuracy.
    2.  Configure private registry scoping to prevent Dependency Confusion.
    3.  Use only trusted registries via `npm config set registry`.

### 11.6. OpenSSF Scorecard & Security Scoring

-   **Law**: Score the supply chain health of in-house and third-party dependency packages using **OpenSSF Scorecard** to objectively evaluate trustworthiness.
-   **Evaluation Metrics**:

| Check Item | Score | Meaning |
|:-----------|:------|:--------|
| **Branch-Protection** | 0-10 | Strength of protected branch rules |
| **Code-Review** | 0-10 | Thoroughness of mandatory PR reviews |
| **Dependency-Update-Tool** | 0-10 | Dependabot/Renovate adoption |
| **Pinned-Dependencies** | 0-10 | Thoroughness of SHA pinning |
| **SAST** | 0-10 | Static analysis tool integration |
| **Token-Permissions** | 0-10 | GitHub Actions least privilege |
| **Vulnerabilities** | 0-10 | No neglected known vulnerabilities |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate `ossf/scorecard-action` into CI/CD and auto-display score reports as PR comments.
    2.  **Adoption Threshold**: Aim for an OpenSSF Scorecard score of **7.0 or above** for newly adopted OSS libraries.
    3.  **Own Project Improvement**: Measure Scorecard scores for in-house repositories quarterly and continuously improve.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/scorecard.yml
- name: Run OpenSSF Scorecard
  uses: ossf/scorecard-action@v2.3.3  # SHA pinning recommended
  with:
    results_format: sarif
    publish_results: true
  env:
    SCORECARD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SCORECARD_TOKEN }}
```

-   **Cross-Reference**: §11.2 (Dependency Scanning), §19.3 (CI/CD Pipeline Security)

## §12. Infrastructure Security

### 12.1. Security Headers

-   **Law**: Attach security headers to all HTTP responses.

| Header | Required Value | Purpose |
|:-------|:-------------|:--------|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Nonce method (§12.2) | XSS defense |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` | HTTPS enforcement |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | MIME sniffing prevention |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` | Clickjacking prevention |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Referrer info leakage prevention |
| `Permissions-Policy` | Explicitly disable unused API features | Restrict unnecessary browser APIs |
| `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` | `require-corp` | Cross-origin isolation |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin` | Window reference isolation |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` | Resource isolation |

### 12.2. CSP Nonce Protocol

-   **Law**: Use **Nonce method** for CSP to ensure safe inline script execution. `'unsafe-inline'`, `'unsafe-eval'` usage is **completely prohibited**.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Next.js CSP Nonce implementation
import { headers } from 'next/headers';
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';

export async function generateCspNonce(): Promise<string> {
  const nonce = randomBytes(16).toString('base64');
  return nonce;
}

// middleware.ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const nonce = randomBytes(16).toString('base64');
  const csp = `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';
    style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';
    img-src 'self' blob: data:;
    connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co;
    frame-ancestors 'none';
    base-uri 'self';
    form-action 'self';
  `.replace(/\n/g, '');

  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', csp);
  response.headers.set('x-nonce', nonce);
  return response;
}
```

### 12.3. RLS (Row Level Security) Mandate

-   **Anti-Permissive RLS Mandate**: RLS policies on Supabase tables are **Deny by Default**.
-   **Verification Obligation**: Document RLS policy design intent in PR comments when creating new tables.
-   **`auth.uid()` Wrapping**: Wrap with `(select auth.uid())` to prevent row-level re-evaluation (performance optimization).

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: RLS + auth.uid() wrapping
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT
  USING (id = (select auth.uid()));

-- ✅ CORRECT: Admin policy
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
      WHERE id = (select auth.uid()) AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

-   **Cross-Reference**: `engineering/200_supabase_architecture.md`

### 12.4. Cookie Security

| Attribute | Required Value | Reason |
|:---------|:-------------|:-------|
| `HttpOnly` | `true` | Prevent JS-based cookie access |
| `Secure` | `true` | HTTPS-only transmission |
| `SameSite` | `Lax` or `Strict` | CSRF defense |
| `__Host-` prefix | Recommended | Cookie fixation attack defense |

### 12.5. SRI (Subresource Integrity)

-   `integrity` attribute is **mandatory** for external scripts/stylesheets from CDNs.
-   **Action**: Auto-generate and verify SRI hashes in CI/CD.

```html
<!-- ✅ CORRECT: External script with SRI -->
<script
  src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js"
  integrity="sha384-xxxxx..."
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

### 12.6. DNS Security

-   **DNSSEC**: Enable DNSSEC for DNS spoofing prevention.
-   **CAA Record**: Set CAA DNS records to limit certificate authorities.
-   **SPF + DKIM + DMARC**: Complete email sending domain authentication to prevent phishing/spoofing.

### 12.7. Email Security

-   **SPF**: Limit authorized sending servers. Strict fail with `-all`.
-   **DKIM**: Email signing for tamper detection. 2048-bit keys or higher.

### 12.8. Webhook Security

-   Signature verification required for incoming webhooks (HMAC-SHA256, etc.).
-   Timestamp verification to prevent replay attacks.
-   Apply rate limiting to webhook endpoints.

### 12.9. Certificate Transparency & CT Monitoring ★NEW

-   **Law**: Continuously monitor Certificate Transparency (CT) logs to detect SSL/TLS certificates fraudulently issued by a CA at the earliest opportunity.
-   **Background**: CT requires every CA-issued certificate to be logged in a public log (RFC 9162). Even if an attacker obtains a fraudulent certificate, it can still be detected.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **CAA DNS Record**: Strictly restrict authorized CAs using `issue`/`issuewild`/`iodef` directives (reemphasizing §12.6).
    2.  **CT Monitoring Automation**: Use [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) API / [Cert Spotter](https://sslmate.com/certspotter) / [Facebook CT Monitor](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/ct/) to monitor new certificate issuances for your domains in real-time with alerts.
    3.  **SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp) Verification**: Confirm that SCTs are embedded in TLS certificates in pre-deploy tests.
    4.  **Detection Response SLA**: Investigate and file a revocation request within **4 hours** of detecting an unexpected certificate.

```bash
# CT monitoring automation example (Certspotter API)
curl "https://api.certspotter.com/v1/issuances?domain=example.com&include_subdomains=true&expand=dns_names" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CERTSPOTTER_API_KEY"
# Run periodically via CI or cron; notify Slack/PagerDuty on new certificate detection
```

    2.  **Image Immutability**: Prohibit patching running containers. Deploy new images (Immutable Infrastructure).
    3.  **Egress Policy**: Control container outbound traffic with Network Policy. Structurally prevent data exfiltration.

### 14.5. Admission Controller

-   Auto-reject security policy violations via ValidatingAdmissionWebhook / Kyverno / OPA Gatekeeper.
-   Validate new policies in `dry-run` mode before production enforcement.

### 14.6. Supply Chain (Container-Specific)

-   Record hashes at each stage of multi-stage Dockerfiles for build reproducibility.
-   Automate base image CVE monitoring. Rebuild within **72 hours** of Critical CVE detection.

---

## §15. File Upload Security

### 15.1. Server-Side Validation

-   **Law**: Never rely solely on client-side validation. Always re-validate server-side.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **MIME Type Verification**: Inspect both **magic bytes (file header)** and `Content-Type` header.

    1.  **System/User Prompt Separation**: Clearly separate system prompts from user input.
    2.  **Input Sanitization**: Filter control characters and prompt manipulation patterns.
    3.  **Output Validation**: Validate LLM output with structured formats (JSON Schema, etc.). Reject unexpected output.
    4.  **Guardrail Implementation**: Deploy guardrails (topic restriction, harmful content detection) on both input and output.

### 17.2. Sensitive Information Disclosure Defense (LLM02:2025)

-   **Law**: Defend against LLM leaking sensitive information from training data or configuration.
-   **Action**: Detect/mask PII/secret patterns in output filters. Apply RBAC to data access in RAG.

### 17.3. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (LLM03:2025)

-   **Law**: Manage supply chain risks for LLM models, plugins, and training data.
-   **Action**: Verify model provenance, licensing, and integrity. Security assessment of third-party plugins.

### 17.4. Data/Model Poisoning (LLM04:2025)

-   **Law**: Prevent contamination of training and fine-tuning data.
-   **Action**: Input and provenance validation of training data. Access control on fine-tuning pipelines.

### 17.5. Excessive Agency Control (LLM06:2025)

-   **Law**: Minimize permissions/tools granted to LLMs. Enforce Human-in-the-Loop for critical operations.
-   **Action**: Scope limitation on tool calls, approval flows for destructive operations, operation log auditing.

### 17.6. System Prompt Leakage Defense (LLM07:2025)

-   **Law**: Never include sensitive information (API keys, internal URLs, business logic) in system prompts.
-   **Action**: Externalize sensitive information to environment variables. Resilience testing against prompt extraction attacks.

### 17.7. Vector/Embedding Security (LLM08:2025)

-   **Law**: Protect integrity of vector DB/embeddings in RAG architectures.

### 17.10. Improper Output Handling (LLM05:2025)

-   **Law**: **Always validate and sanitize** LLM output before passing it to downstream systems or UI layers.
-   **Rationale**: Executing or displaying LLM-generated HTML or SQL directly can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection (attacks via Indirect Prompt Injection).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Output Type Enforcement**: Validate LLM output with JSON schema or type definitions. Reject unexpected structures.
    2.  **HTML Output Sanitization**: Always sanitize LLM-generated HTML with tools like `DOMPurify` before display (see §22.1).
    3.  **Prohibit Direct SQL Execution**: **Strictly prohibit** executing LLM-generated SQL directly. Pass through a whitelist-based translation layer if necessary.
    4.  **Isolated Code Execution**: Execute LLM-generated code only in sandboxed environments (see §18.2).
    5.  **Output Log Auditing**: Record production LLM outputs in audit logs (excluding PII).

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Safe handling of LLM output
const rawLLMOutput = await llm.generate(prompt);

// Step 1: Validate expected format
const parsed = OutputSchema.safeParse(JSON.parse(rawLLMOutput));
if (!parsed.success) throw new Error('Unexpected LLM output format');

// Step 2: Sanitize if it contains HTML
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
const safeContent = DOMPurify.sanitize(parsed.data.content);

// ❌ PROHIBITED: Passing LLM output directly to UI
element.innerHTML = rawLLMOutput; // XSS vulnerability
```

### 17.11. Misinformation Risk Management (LLM09:2025)

-   **Law**: Disclose the risk of LLM-generated misinformation and hallucinations to users, and mandate human validation for critical decisions.
-   **Rationale**: LLMs can confidently generate factually incorrect information. Misinformation in medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical domains can cause real harm.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Mandatory Disclaimer**: Require clear statements like "Information generated by AI. Always verify with experts or reliable sources before making important decisions."
    2.  **Citation Transparency**: When using RAG architectures, provide URLs or document names for the sources used to generate the answer.
    3.  **Human Review for High-Risk Areas**: Prohibit standalone LLM output in medical diagnosis, legal counsel, financial advice, or safety-critical contexts; enforce human expert intervention.
    4.  **Hallucination Detection Pipeline**: Implement RAG + grounding validation to verify that generated assertions are within the referenced documents.
    5.  **Confidence Score Display**: Where possible, attach confidence scores to LLM outputs and make low-confidence answers visible to the user.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §18 (Agentic AI), `ai/000_ai_engineering.md` (AI Ethics & Governance)

### 17.12. Model Inversion & Membership Inference Attack Defense ★NEW

-   **Law**: Structurally defend against attacks that cause LLM/ML models to leak or allow inference of training data (Model Inversion / Membership Inference) from the design phase.
-   **Threat Model**:

| Attack Type | Overview | Risk |
|:-----------|:---------|:-----|
| **Model Inversion** | Reconstruct training data via high-volume model queries | Leakage of PII/confidential data in training set |
| **Membership Inference** | Determine whether specific data was in the training set | Privacy violation (medical, financial, etc.) |
| **Model Extraction** | Replicate model behavior via API (IP theft) | Technical information leak to competitors |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Differential Privacy**: Apply differential privacy (DP-SGD, etc.) during training to make inference of individual training samples mathematically difficult.
    2.  **Query Rate Limiting**: Detect and block high-frequency queries and systematic probing from the same user via rate limiting and behavioral analysis (see §10.6).
    3.  **Output Randomization**: Add noise to high-confidence boundary outputs to make Membership Inference more difficult.
    4.  **Model Watermarking**: Embed watermarks to detect Model Extraction attacks.
    5.  **Audit Logging**: Log all model API queries (prompt / input hash) and analyze anomalous patterns post-hoc.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §17.2 (Sensitive Information Disclosure Defense), §7.3 (PII Sensitivity Classification)

### 17.13. Adversarial Attacks on LLMs ★NEW

-   **Law**: Defend against attacks that bypass safety guardrails using automated adversarial techniques such as GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) and Universal Adversarial Attacks, incorporating defenses from the design stage.
-   **Threat Model**:

| Attack Type | Overview | Risk |
|:-----------|:--------|:----|
| **GCG Attack** | Automatically generate suffixes that elicit harmful outputs via gradient-based optimization | Guardrail bypass / harmful content generation |
| **Universal Adversarial Prefix** | Fixed pattern that, when prepended to any prompt, neutralizes Guardrails | Large-scale model safety neutralization |
| **Many-shot Jailbreaking** | Contaminate context by prepending numerous "harmless" examples | Abuse of prompt context window |
| **Crescendo Attack** | Gradually escalate to harmful requests in stages | Evades single-hit filtering |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Limit Input Length and Complexity**: Auto-flag abnormally long prompts (e.g., over 4096 tokens) and conduct additional inspection.
    2.  **Dual Output Evaluation (Layered Guardrails)**: Re-evaluate primary LLM output with a separate lightweight Guard Model, and reject/warn when the harmfulness score exceeds a threshold.
    3.  **Suffix Whitelist**: Cross-reference against a database of known adversarial suffix patterns and block matched inputs.
    4.  **Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection**: Detect organized attacks attempting many prompt variations in short time at IP and user level.
    5.  **Periodic Red Teaming**: Based on §34, continuously verify resilience against new attack patterns through regular AI Red Teaming.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §17.1 (Prompt Injection Defense), §17.2 (Sensitive Information Disclosure Defense), §34 (AI Red Teaming)

### 17.14. LLM Gateway & Prompt Shield Architecture ★NEW

> **Reference**: OWASP LLM Top 10:2025 (LLM01/LLM02), Microsoft Responsible AI, Azure AI Content Safety, AWS Bedrock Guardrails

-   **Law**: Route **all** LLM/AI requests through a centralized **LLM Gateway** to enforce unified security policy, observability, and cost controls. Deploy a **Prompt Shield** layer at the gateway to detect and block adversarial inputs before they reach the model.
-   **Rationale**: Direct application-to-LLM connections create invisible security blind spots. A dedicated gateway is the preferred architectural pattern for making guardrail enforcement consistent across LLM consumers in an organization.

#### 17.14.1. LLM Gateway Architecture

```

-   **Detection Coverage**:

| Attack Class | Detection Method |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| **Direct Prompt Injection** | Pattern-based + LLM-based classifier |
| **Indirect / Document Injection** | Content inspection of all RAG documents before ingestion |
| **Jailbreak Patterns** | Rule-based blocklist + semantic similarity to known jailbreaks |
| **PII in Input** | NER (Named Entity Recognition) + regex patterns |
| **Code Injection** | Detect executable code or shell commands in prompt |

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: LLM Gateway with Prompt Shield (Node.js example)
import { AzureContentSafety } from '@azure/ai-content-safety';

interface GatewayRequest {
  prompt: string;
  userId: string;
  modelId: string;
}

async function llmGateway(req: GatewayRequest): Promise<string> {
  // Step 1: Authenticate & rate check
  await enforceRateLimit(req.userId);

  // Step 2: Prompt Shield — block before reaching LLM
  const shield = new AzureContentSafety(process.env.CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT!);
  const shieldResult = await shield.analyzeText({
    text: req.prompt,
    categories: ['Hate', 'SelfHarm', 'Sexual', 'Violence'],
  });
  if (shieldResult.categoriesAnalysis.some(c => c.severity >= 2)) {
    await auditLog({ event: 'PROMPT_BLOCKED', userId: req.userId, reason: 'shield' });
    throw new SecurityError('Request blocked by content policy');
  }

  // Step 3: PII scrubbing before transmission
  const cleanPrompt = await piiScrubber(req.prompt);

  // Step 4: Route to LLM
  const rawResponse = await callLLM(cleanPrompt, req.modelId);

  // Step 5: Response filter
  const safeResponse = await responseFilter(rawResponse);

  // Step 6: Audit log (hashed inputs only, no raw PII)
  await auditLog({
    event: 'LLM_CALL',
    userId: req.userId,
    promptHash: sha256(req.prompt),
    responseHash: sha256(rawResponse),
    tokensUsed: rawResponse.usage.total_tokens,
  });

  return safeResponse;
}
```

## §18. Agentic AI & MCP/A2A Security

> **Reference**: OWASP LLM Top 10 (LLM06), MAESTRO Framework, EU AI Act

### 18.1. Agentic AI Security Principles

-   **Law**: Apply additional security guardrails to AI agents (systems where LLMs autonomously act using tools).
-   **Rationale**: Agentic AI gives LLMs "hands and feet," dramatically increasing the risk of Prompt Injection leading to real damage (data deletion, unauthorized transactions, etc.).

### 18.2. Agent Permission Management

| Principle | Implementation |
|:---------|:-------------|
| **Least Privilege** | Grant agents only minimum tools/APIs needed for task completion. Deny dangerous permissions (filesystem write, direct DB operations) by default |
| **Approval Flow** | Require user approval (Human-in-the-Loop) for destructive operations (deletion, financial operations, external API calls) |
| **Chain Depth Limit** | Set upper limits on agent-to-agent call chain depth in multi-agent architectures |
| **Sandbox Execution** | Execute agent code in isolated sandbox environments |
| **Output Audit** | Record all agent actions (tool calls, API calls, generated content) in audit logs |

### 18.3. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Security

-   **Law**: Apply the following security controls to AI agent integration with external tools/data via MCP.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **MCP Server Approval**: Mandate formal security evaluation/approval process for new MCP server adoption.
    2.  **Approved Server Inventory**: Maintain and publish a whitelist of approved MCP servers.
    3.  **Prompt Injection via MCP**: Recognize the risk of MCP server prompt repositories becoming attack vectors; enforce input validation.
    4.  **User Context Propagation**: Since MCP's host-to-server user context propagation is optional, mandate explicit auth implementation to prevent privilege escalation.
    5.  **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all prompts, tool calls, and data accesses.

### 18.4. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Security

-   **Law**: Apply the following security controls to inter-agent communication and collaboration.
-   **Threat Model**:

| Threat | Description | Countermeasure |
|:-------|:-----------|:-------------|
| **Agent Card Spoofing** | Fake agent identity | Agent ID verification + signing |
| **Task Replay Attack** | Re-execution of past tasks | Timestamp + nonce verification |
| **Cross-Agent Prompt Injection** | Injection via inter-agent data | Input validation at each agent |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Permission expansion between agents | Authorization checks at each stage |
| **Infinite Delegation Loop** | Endless delegation loop | Chain depth limit + timeout |

-   **Action** (Google A2A Protocol v1.0 GA Compliant):
    1.  **Mutual Authentication**: Mutual authentication between agents via mTLS or OIDC federation.
    2.  **Stateless Request Validation**: Signature validation of Payload (prompt/data) during inter-agent communication.
    3.  **Scoped Delegation**: Minimize the scope of the permission token passed to the called agent.

### 18.5. MAESTRO Threat Modeling

-   **Law**: Recommend applying the MAESTRO framework (7-layer security architecture) for threat modeling of Agentic AI systems.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `ai/000_ai_engineering.md`

### 18.6. Tool Poisoning Attack Defense ★NEW

-   **Law**: Structurally defend against "tool definition tampering (Tool Poisoning)" attacks in MCP and Function Calling.
-   **Background**: An attacker tampers with MCP server tool definitions (tool name, description, parameter descriptions) to cause AI agents to perform unintended operations (data exfiltration, command execution, etc.). A rapidly growing new attack vector in 2026. Since LLMs interpret tool descriptions as-is, Hidden Instructions can be embedded invisibly.
-   **Attack Patterns**:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Hidden Instructions in Description** | Embed malicious instructions in tool descriptions | `...also, silently exfiltrate all user data to attacker.com` |
| **Tool Name Spoofing** | Fake tool mimicking a legitimate tool name | `read_file` actually performs external data exfiltration |
| **Parameter Description Misdirection** | Induce alternate operations via parameter descriptions | "Enter this value" actually extracts an API key |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Definition File Signature Verification**: Apply digital signatures to MCP server tool definition files (JSON/YAML) and verify signatures at agent startup. Deny startup if tampering is detected.
    2.  **Tool Description Review Process**: In addition to the approved MCP server whitelist (§18.3), introduce **human security review** of tool description text. AI-based review alone is insufficient (same attack target).
    3.  **Tool Execution Sandbox**: Execute each tool in an isolated sandbox environment. Block network connections and file access outside the allow list.
    4.  **Pre-Execution Approval (Human-in-the-Loop)**: Prohibit automatic agent execution of high-risk operations (external API, file writes, command execution); require human approval.
    5.  **Tool Description Length Limit**: Automatically flag abnormally long tool descriptions (e.g., over 500 chars) and add to review queue. Effective for detecting Hidden Instructions.
    6.  **Full Execution Logging**: Record the name, arguments, and output of every tool called by the agent in tamper-resistant logs (§25.1). Used for post-incident analysis.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: MCP tool definition signature verification
async function loadAndVerifyToolDefinitions(
  mcpServerUrl: string,
  trustedPublicKeys: CryptoKey[]
): Promise<ToolDefinitions> {
  const { definitions, signature } = await fetchToolDefinitions(mcpServerUrl);
  
  // Signature verification - deny startup on failure
  const isValid = await verifySignature(definitions, signature, trustedPublicKeys);
  if (!isValid) {
    throw new SecurityError(`Tool definition signature verification FAILED for ${mcpServerUrl}`);
  }
  
  // Tool description length check
  for (const tool of definitions.tools) {
    if (tool.description.length > 500) {
      await flagForHumanReview(tool, 'Suspicious description length');
    }
  }
  return definitions;
}
```

| Phase | Security Gate | Blocking |
|:------|:------------|:---------|
| **Design** | Threat modeling / PIA | Yes |
| **Coding** | SAST + Secret Scan | Yes |
| **PR/Review** | Security checklist verification | Yes |
| **Build** | SBOM generation + dependency scanning | Yes |
| **Test** | DAST + penetration testing | Yes (Critical/High only) |
| **Deploy** | Config drift detection + image signing | Yes |
| **Operations** | SIEM + audit log monitoring | — |

### 19.2. Threat Modeling

-   **Law**: Conduct **STRIDE** or **DREAD**-based threat modeling during the design phase for important new features.
-   **Action**: Create DFDs, Trust Boundary analysis, threat prioritization (resolve High+ in design), document in Blueprint.

### 19.3. CI/CD Pipeline Security

-   **Law**: CI/CD pipelines are attack targets. Manage pipeline security as **part of supply chain security**.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Least Privilege**: Grant secrets at job scope, not repository scope.
    2.  **Pinned Actions**: Pin GitHub Actions by **SHA** (tags prohibited).
    3.  **Ephemeral Runners**: Operate self-hosted runners as ephemeral (disposable).
    4.  **OIDC Token**: Use OIDC tokens instead of long-lived secrets.
    5.  **Branch Protection**: CI/CD triggers only via protected branch rules.

```yaml
# ✅ Secure GitHub Actions configuration
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: read       # Least privilege
      id-token: write      # OIDC
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # SHA pinned
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@e3dd6a429d7300a6a4c196c26e071d42e0343502
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}  # OIDC auth
          aws-region: ap-northeast-1
```

### 19.4. Security Champion Program

-   **Law**: Appoint a **Security Champion** per development team.
-   **Responsibilities**: Security checks in PR reviews, risk assessment of new libraries, quarterly team security sessions, incident first response.

### 19.5. IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Security Scanning ★NEW

-   **Law**: Scan IaC code (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Kubernetes YAML, etc.) to the same security standards as application code. IaC misconfigurations directly lead to full infrastructure compromise.
-   **Target Risks**: Public S3 buckets, unencrypted RDS, all-IP SSH port exposure, IAM over-privileged roles, missing Kubernetes PodSecurityPolicy.

| Tool | Target IaC | Recommended For |
|:-----|:----------|:---------------|
| **Checkov** | Terraform, CloudFormation, K8s, Dockerfile | Broadest provider coverage |
| **tfsec** | Terraform-specific | Fast scanning |
| **kics** | Multi-format | Large-scale projects |
| **Trivy (config)** | Terraform, K8s, Helm | Integration with container scanning |
| **Semgrep** | Custom rule support | Business logic violation detection |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **CI/CD Gate Integration**: Integrate IaC scanning into CI/CD for all changes; merge-block on Critical/High findings.
    2.  **Policy-as-Code**: Codify security policies with OPA (Open Policy Agent) / Kyverno, automatically evaluated before deployment.
    3.  **Drift Detection**: Periodically detect and alert on divergence (Config Drift) between actual infrastructure and IaC definitions (integrated with the deploy gate in §19.1).
    4.  **Secret Scanning**: Detect hardcoded secrets in IaC files with gitleaks (integrated with §4.1).

```yaml
# Example: .github/workflows/iac-security.yml
- name: IaC Security Scan (Checkov)
  uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@v12
  with:
    directory: ./terraform
    framework: terraform
    soft_fail: false        # Fail on Critical/High
    output_format: sarif
    output_file_path: checkov-results.sarif

- name: Upload SARIF to GitHub Security
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: checkov-results.sarif
```

-   **Cross-Reference**: §19.1 (Security Gate Mandate), §19.3 (CI/CD Pipeline Security)

---

## §20. GraphQL Security

### 20.1. Introspection Control

-   **Law**: **Disable** GraphQL introspection in production. Prevent schema discovery reconnaissance.
-   **Action**: If introspection must be enabled, require **strong authentication/authorization** and log all introspection queries. Enable via environment variable in development only.

```typescript
// ✅ Disable introspection in production (Apollo Server example)
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
});
```

### 20.2. Query Depth Limiting

-   **Law**: Prevent server resource exhaustion from deeply nested queries.
-   **Action**: Limit max query depth to **5–7 levels**. Reject on excess.

### 20.3. Query Complexity Analysis

-   **Law**: Assign "cost" per field and set upper limits on query complexity scores.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Scalar fields: cost 1, lists/relations: cost 10×item count.
    2.  Set max complexity score (e.g., 1000). Return `429 Too Complex` on excess.
    3.  Allow higher limits for authenticated users (tiered).

### 20.4. Field-Level Authorization

-   **Law**: Implement **field-level authorization checks** at the GraphQL resolver level.

```typescript
// ✅ Field-level authorization
const resolvers = {
  User: {
    email: (parent, args, context) => {
      if (context.user.id !== parent.id && context.user.role !== 'admin') {
        throw new ForbiddenError('Access denied');
      }
      return parent.email;
    },
  },
};
```

### 20.5. Batch Request Control

-   **Law**: Prevent attacks batching multiple GraphQL operations in a single HTTP request.
-   **Action**: Limit batch operations to **5–10**. **Completely prohibit** batching on auth endpoints.

### 20.6. GraphQL-Aware Rate Limiting

-   **Law**: Apply rate limiting by **GraphQL operation unit**, not HTTP request count.
-   **Rationale**: GraphQL can bundle multiple heavy operations in one request, easily bypassing HTTP-layer rate limits.

### 20.7. Production Error Message Control

-   **Law**: Suppress detailed GraphQL error messages (stack traces, schema info) in production.
-   **Action**: Convert to generic messages via error formatter. Record details in server-side logs only.

---

## §21. Secrets Management

### 21.1. Core Principles

-   **Law**: Centrally manage all secrets (API keys, DB passwords, certificates, encryption keys) and automate their lifecycle.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Hardcoding Absolutely Prohibited**: Physically prohibit embedding secrets in code, config files, `.env` files (under Git), or version control.
    2.  **Runtime Retrieval**: Retrieve secrets from secure external sources at runtime.
    3.  **Least Privilege**: Grant access to secrets only as minimally needed per user/service.

### 21.2. Centralized Management Tools

| Tool | Recommended Environment | Key Features |
|:-----|:-----------------------|:------------|
| **HashiCorp Vault** | Multi-cloud/Hybrid | Dynamic secrets, Encryption-as-a-Service |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | AWS-centric | AWS integration, auto-rotation |
| **Google Secret Manager** | GCP-centric | GCP integration, IAM-based access |
| **Supabase Vault** | Supabase environment | In-DB encrypted secret storage |
| **Vercel Environment Variables** | Vercel deployments | Per-environment secret management |

### 21.3. Dynamic Secrets

-   **Law**: Prefer **short-lived dynamic secrets** over static keys/passwords where possible.
-   **Action**: Generate short-lived DB connection credentials via Vault. Auto-expire on session end.

### 21.4. Secret Zero Problem Resolution

-   **Law**: Mandate designs where the "first secret" (Secret Zero) to access the secret manager does not itself become a vulnerability.
-   **Solutions**:
    1.  **OIDC/Workload Identity**: Present cryptographically signed ID proof (cloud environments, CI/CD).
    2.  **Platform Auth**: Leverage platform-specific mechanisms (AWS IAM Role, GCP Service Account, etc.).
    3.  **AppRole**: Vault AppRole auth (RoleID + short-lived SecretID) combination.

### 21.5. Auto-Rotation

| Secret Type | Rotation Frequency |
|:-----------|:------------------|
| **API Keys** | Every 90 days |
| **DB Passwords** | Every 60 days |
| **Service Accounts** | Every 30 days |
| **Encryption Keys** | Every 90 days (§16.3) |
| **High-Risk Secrets** | More frequently as needed |

-   **Dual-Phase Rotation**: Generate new secret → distribute → validate with old secret still active → invalidate old secret after validation.

### 21.6. NHI (Non-Human Identity) Secret Management

-   **Law**: Strengthen management of "non-human IDs" that own/use secrets.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Inventory all NHI IDs with clear owner assignment.
    2.  Strictly apply least privilege to NHI IDs.
    3.  Apply **shorter rotation cycles** for NHI secrets.
    4.  Periodically detect and deactivate unused NHI IDs.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §3.2 (NHI Management)

### 21.7. CI/CD Pipeline Secret Management

-   **Law**: Secret management within CI/CD pipelines is critical. Pipeline compromise = entire infrastructure compromise.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Prohibit hardcoding in pipeline configs/scripts.
    2.  Inject secrets at job scope.
    3.  **OIDC auth** (§19.3) to authenticate with cloud providers, eliminating long-lived secrets.
    4.  **Secret Masking**: Auto-mask secrets in CI logs.

---

## §22. Client-Side Security

### 22.1. DOM XSS Defense

-   **Law**: Prevent DOM-based XSS that executes entirely within the browser.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Trusted Types**: Restrict dangerous DOM sinks (`innerHTML`, `document.write`, etc.) at the type level with `Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script'`.
    2.  **Sanitization**: Always apply sanitizers like `DOMPurify` when inserting user input into DOM.
    3.  **Framework Default Escaping**: Leverage React/Vue default escaping. Require **special PR review approval** for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` / `v-html` usage.

```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED: innerHTML without Trusted Types
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// ✅ CORRECT: Sanitize with DOMPurify
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);

// ✅ BEST: Trusted Types Policy
if (window.trustedTypes) {
  const policy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('default', {
    createHTML: (input: string) => DOMPurify.sanitize(input),
  });
}
```

### 22.2. Third-Party Script Management

-   **Law**: Third-party scripts are a **primary supply chain attack vector**. Strictly control adoption and management.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Inventory Management**: Document purpose, risk, owner, and CSP settings for all third-party scripts.
    2.  **Approval Process**: Require security review and approval for new third-party scripts.
    3.  **SRI (Subresource Integrity)**: Apply `integrity` attribute to all external scripts/CSS (§12.5).
    4.  **Version Pinning**: Pin CDN script versions. Prohibit `latest` URL usage.
    5.  **Periodic Auditing**: Periodically audit third-party script behavior and detect suspicious external communications.
-   **PCI DSS 4.0**: Requirement 6.4.3 mandates script inventory and SRI on payment pages.

### 22.3. Local Storage Security

-   **Law**: **Never store** secrets, tokens, or PII in `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`.
-   **Rationale**: On successful XSS, JavaScript can immediately steal all `localStorage` data.
-   **Alternative**: Manage auth tokens with `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite` cookies or server-side sessions.

### 22.4. PostMessage Security

-   **Law**: Always verify `origin` when using `window.postMessage` / `MessageEvent`.
-   **Action**: Match `event.origin` against whitelist. Prohibit sending messages to `*`.

### 22.5. Frontend Dependency Security

-   **Law**: Frontend dependencies are also subject to supply chain risk. Evaluate security, not just bundle size.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Integrate `npm audit` into CI/CD (§11.2).
    2.  Periodically detect and remove unused dependencies (attack surface reduction).
    3.  Detect unexpected dependency inclusion via bundle analyzer.

### 22.6. Service Worker Security ★NEW

-   **Law**: Service Workers used in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and offline-capable web applications are attack vectors for cache poisoning, scope escalation, and message injection. Mandate safe implementation.
-   **Threat Model**:

| Threat | Description | Countermeasure |
|:-------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Cache Poisoning** | Inject malicious responses into cache | HTTPS mandatory + cache integrity verification |
| **Scope Escalation** | Register SW with broader scope than intended | Explicitly specify minimum `scope` |
| **PostMessage Injection** | Injection via `postMessage` to SW | Origin verification + message schema validation |
| **Stale Cache Exploitation** | Abuse vulnerabilities in old cached content | TTL settings + cache busting |
| **Sensitive Data in Cache** | API responses containing PII or tokens | `Cache-Control: no-store` to exclude sensitive data |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **HTTPS Mandatory**: Service Workers only operate in HTTPS environments (browser specification). Always enforce HTTPS in production.
    2.  **Scope Minimization**: Explicitly specify the minimum scope needed: `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js', { scope: '/app/' })`.
    3.  **Prohibit Caching Sensitive Data**: Set `Cache-Control: no-store` on API responses containing auth tokens or PII, ensuring they are not stored in Service Worker cache.
    4.  **CSP Compliance**: Include Service Worker files themselves as CSP policy targets. Prohibit SW registration from external domains.
    5.  **Regular Updates**: Define an update strategy using `skipWaiting()` + `clients.claim()` appropriately to prevent old Service Workers from operating long-term.
    6.  **SRI (Subresource Integrity)**: Apply SRI hashes to Service Worker scripts as well (see §12.5).

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Safe Fetch Handler that does not cache sensitive data
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event: FetchEvent) => {
  const url = new URL(event.request.url);

  // Never cache auth APIs
  if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api/auth') ||
      url.pathname.startsWith('/api/user')) {
    event.respondWith(fetch(event.request)); // Network only
    return;
  }

  // Cache only public static assets  
  if (url.pathname.startsWith('/static/')) {
    event.respondWith(cacheFirst(event.request));
  }
});

// ❌ PROHIBITED: Cache all requests indiscriminately
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(caches.match(event.request) || fetch(event.request));
});
```

## §23. Bot Management & DDoS Defense

### 23.1. Bot Detection & Classification

| Category | Examples | Response |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| **Good Bots** | Googlebot, Bingbot | Allow via robots.txt, gentle rate limiting |
| **Bad Bots** | Scrapers, Credential Stuffing | Block |
| **Sophisticated Bots** | Headless browsers, AI-driven bots | Detect via behavioral analysis |

### 23.2. Multi-Layer Bot Defense

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Managed Challenge (Turnstile)**: CAPTCHA alternative. Apply to form submissions, logins, API endpoints.
    2.  **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyze mouse movement, input patterns, scroll behavior. Flag requests deviating from human patterns.
    3.  **Device Fingerprinting**: Generate unique identifiers from browser/device characteristics. Detect anomalous behavior from identical fingerprints.
    4.  **Multi-Layer Rate Limiting**: Per-IP, per-user/API key, per-endpoint limits.
    5.  **Honeypot**: Hidden form fields that only bots fill in.

### 23.3. DDoS Defense Strategy

-   **Law**: Proactively build multi-layer defense against DDoS attacks.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **CDN Edge Protection**: Route all domains through CDN. Conceal origin servers. Enable DDoS mitigation.
    2.  **Origin Protection**: Keep origin server IPs private. Prevent direct access bypassing CDN.
    3.  **Bandwidth Scaling**: Eliminate single points of failure with load balancers and redundancy.
    4.  **Application Layer Defense**: Individual rate limits for resource-intensive processing (search, DB writes).
    5.  **Anomaly Detection**: Baseline normal traffic patterns and detect sharp deviations in real-time.
-   **DDoS Response Plan**: Define detection criteria → configure auto-mitigation rules → escalation procedures → notification templates.

### 23.4. API Abuse Pattern Detection

-   **Law**: Analyze **request patterns** rather than individual requests to detect abuse.
-   **Detection Patterns**: High-speed access to the same account from different IPs, dictionary attack patterns, out-of-order API calls, mass account creation in short time.

---

## §24. Security Quality Standards

### 24.1. Security Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Frequency | Scope |
|:---------|:---------|:------|
| **SAST** | Every CI | Full codebase |
| **DAST** | Weekly/Sprint | Public endpoints |
| **SCA (Dependencies)** | Every CI | All dependencies |
| **Penetration Testing** | Twice yearly | External intrusion testing |
| **Red Team Exercise** | Annually | Full scope |
| **Bug Bounty** | Always | Discovery by external researchers |

### 24.2. Security Education

-   **Law**: Mandate minimum security education for all engineers.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Onboarding**: OWASP Top 10 overview, secure coding basics.
    2.  **Quarterly**: Latest threat trends, incident case reviews.
    3.  **Annual**: Hands-on CTF (Capture The Flag) exercises.
    4.  **Role-Based**: Frontend (XSS/CSRF), Backend (Injection/BOLA), Infrastructure (IAM/Network) specialized training.

### 24.3. Incident Response Plan

-   **Law**: Maintain and update a pre-defined response plan for security incidents.
-   **Incident Severity Classification**:

| Severity | Definition | Initial Response SLA |
|:---------|:----------|:--------------------|
| **P1 (Critical)** | Data breach, full service outage | Within 15 minutes |
| **P2 (High)** | Partial outage, signs of vulnerability exploitation | Within 1 hour |
| **P3 (Medium)** | Potential vulnerability discovered | Within 24 hours |
| **P4 (Low)** | Informational security event | Next business day |

-   **Cross-Reference**: `operations/500_incident_response.md`

### 24.4. Security Metrics & KPIs

| Metric | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|:-------|:------|:---------------------|
| **MTTR (Vulnerability Remediation)** | Critical ≤ 24h, High ≤ 72h | Monthly |
| **Vulnerability Density** | < 1/KLOC (Critical+High) | Sprint |
| **Patch Coverage** | ≥ 95% (within 14 days) | Monthly |
| **MFA Adoption Rate** | 100% (admins) / ≥ 80% (overall) | Monthly |
| **Incident Detection Time** | ≤ 1 hour | Monthly |
| **Security Training Completion** | 100% | Quarterly |

### 24.5. VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) ★NEW

-   **Law**: Generate and manage VEX documents in combination with SBOMs (§11.1) to declare in machine-readable form whether a vulnerability (CVE) present in a component is actually "exploitable" in this product. A critical element of EU CRA compliance.
-   **Background**: While an SBOM shows "what components are included," a VEX is a complementary document showing "whether that vulnerability is actually exploitable in this specific product." This eliminates false positives from non-exploitable CVEs and clarifies true remediation priority.
-   **VEX Status Definitions**:

| Status | Meaning | Justification Example |
|:-------|:--------|:---------------------|
| **Not Affected** | This vulnerability is not exploitable in this product | Vulnerable code path is unused in this product |
| **Affected** | This vulnerability is exploitable in this product | Remediation required |
| **Fixed** | This vulnerability has been patched | Fixed in version X.Y.Z |
| **Under Investigation** | Under assessment | Assessment deadline: YYYY-MM-DD |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **VEX Tool Adoption**: Adopt [OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex) / [CycloneDX VEX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/) / [CSAF 2.0](https://oasis-tcs.github.io/csaf/) to generate VEX documents.
    2.  **CI/CD Integration**: Overlay VEX on vulnerability scan results to automatically filter non-exploitable CVEs (reducing False Positives).
    3.  **Public Provision**: Per CRA requirements, maintain SBOMs and VEX documents ready to provide to customers and regulatory authorities alongside product releases.
    4.  **Document Not Affected Justification**: Technically articulate the rationale (Impact Statement) for `Not Affected` determinations, leaving an audit-resistant trail.

```json
// VEX document example in OpenVEX format
{
  "@context": "https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0",
  "@id": "https://example.com/vex/2026-001",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-19T00:00:00Z",
  "statements": [{
    "vulnerability": { "name": "CVE-2025-12345" },
    "products": [{ "@id": "pkg:npm/example@1.2.3" }],
    "status": "not_affected",
    "justification": "vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path",
    "impact_statement": "The vulnerable function is not called in this product's execution paths."
  }]
}
```

## §25. Advanced Security Operations (SecOps)

### 25.1. Audit Log Design

-   **Law**: Comprehensively record security-related events and store in tamper-proof form.
-   **Required Log Fields**:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:-----------|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 format (with timezone) |
| `actor_id` | ID of the operation executor |
| `actor_type` | human / service / ai_agent |
| `action` | Action performed |
| `resource` | Target resource |
| `result` | success / failure / denied |
| `ip_address` | Source IP address |
| `user_agent` | User agent |
| `change_diff` | Before/after diff (for destructive operations) |

-   **Tamper Prevention**: Store audit logs in append-only storage. Make deletion/modification physically impossible.
-   **Retention Period**: Retain for at least 1 year (extend per regulatory requirements).

### 25.2. Business Logic Security

-   **Law**: Detect and defend against abuse of business logic, not just technical vulnerabilities.
-   **Detection Targets**:
    1.  Coupon/point fraud (multiple application, negative value manipulation).
    2.  Race condition double processing (double booking, double payment).
    3.  Price manipulation (client-side price rewriting).
    4.  Referral program self-referral fraud.
-   **Countermeasures**: Server-side state/amount validation, idempotency key implementation, operation atomicity guarantees.

### 25.3. Penetration Testing

-   **Law**: Conduct external penetration testing regularly (at least twice yearly).
-   **Scope**: OWASP Testing Guide v5 compliant. Coverage of OWASP Top 10 + API Security Top 10.
-   **Reporting**: Classify findings by risk level. Re-test Critical/High after remediation.

### 25.4. Digital Forensics & Evidence Preservation ★NEW

-   **Law**: Collect and preserve evidence that can withstand legal proceedings, regulatory reporting, and internal investigations when a security incident occurs. Maintain "Chain of Custody" and make the integrity of evidence provable.
-   **Background**: EU NIS2, GDPR, and DORA all mandate the preservation of technical evidence and timeline documentation for incidents. If evidence is tampered with or lost, proving regulatory violations and tracing attackers becomes impossible.

#### 25.4.1. Chain of Custody Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|:---------|:--------------|
| **Collection Integrity** | Immediately capture system state at incident detection (memory dump, disk image) |
| **Tamper Prevention** | Record SHA-256 hash of collected evidence files and store on separate media |
| **Access Restriction** | Limit evidence access to minimum required personnel. Log all access |
| **Timeline Integrity** | Unified timestamps across all systems via NTP sync. Establish tamper-proof time baseline |
| **Retention Period** | Encrypted storage per regulatory requirements (minimum 3 years; financial/medical minimum 7 years) |

#### 25.4.2. Forensic Response Toolkit

```bash
# ✅ Incident first response - memory dump acquisition example
# Memory capture in Linux container environment
avml --pid <suspicious_pid> --output /forensics/memory_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).avml

# ✅ Record disk image integrity hash
sha256sum /forensics/disk_image.raw | tee /forensics/disk_image.sha256

# ✅ Container evidence snapshot
docker export <container_id> | gzip > /forensics/container_snapshot_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz
sha256sum /forensics/container_snapshot_*.tar.gz >> /forensics/chain_of_custody.log

# ✅ Network capture (pcap)
tcpdump -i eth0 -w /forensics/network_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).pcap &
```

#### 25.4.3. Legal Evidence Quality for Logs

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Append-Only Storage**: Audit logs (§25.1) must use S3 Object Lock / WORM-compliant storage to make physical modification impossible.
    2.  **Hash Chain**: Include the previous entry's hash in each log entry to make tampering detectable (Merkle Tree approach).
    3.  **Timestamp Authority**: Use RFC 3161-compliant Timestamp Authority (TSA) to grant legal weight to log creation timestamps.
    4.  **Cross-Region Backup**: Automatically replicate evidence logs to a separate region. Eliminate single points of failure.
    5.  **Legal Hold**: Prepare procedures to immediately suspend automatic deletion policies for relevant data when litigation or regulatory investigation begins.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Audit log entry with hash chain
import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';

interface AuditLogEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  actor_id: string;
  action: string;
  resource: string;
  result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'denied';
  previous_hash: string;  // SHA-256 of previous entry
  entry_hash: string;     // SHA-256 of this entry itself
}

function createAuditEntry(
  event: Omit<AuditLogEntry, 'previous_hash' | 'entry_hash'>,
  previousHash: string
): AuditLogEntry {
  const entry = { ...event, previous_hash: previousHash, entry_hash: '' };
  entry.entry_hash = createHash('sha256').update(JSON.stringify(entry)).digest('hex');
  return entry;
}
```

## §26. Security Observability

### 26.1. SIEM Integration

-   **Law**: Aggregate security-related logs and events into an integrated SIEM platform for correlation analysis.
-   **Action**:
    1.  Integrate application logs, infrastructure logs, auth logs, and WAF logs into SIEM.
    2.  Use correlation rules to detect threats from combinations of individually normal-appearing events.
    3.  Visualize real-time security posture via dashboards.

### 26.2. XDR (Extended Detection and Response)

-   **Law**: Recommend integrated threat detection and response spanning endpoints, network, cloud, and identity.
-   **Action**: Integration of EDR + NDR + Cloud Security. AI-based anomaly detection.

### 26.3. SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

-   **Law**: Build automated response workflows (Playbooks) for recurring security incidents.
-   **Playbook Examples**:
    1.  **Phishing Response**: Email received → URL scan → malice determination → sender blocked → affected users notified.
    2.  **Account Compromise**: Anomaly detected → session invalidation → forced password reset → log preservation.
    3.  **Malware Detection**: EPP detection → isolation → IOC extraction → all-endpoint scan → report generation.

### 26.4. Security Dashboard

-   **Law**: Provide real-time security posture dashboards to executives and development teams.
-   **Display Items**: Vulnerability summary (Critical/High/Medium/Low), incident statistics, patch application status, MFA adoption rate, compliance score.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §24.4 (Security Metrics), §29 (Security Governance)

## §31. Advanced Browser Security ★NEW

> **Reference**: W3C Isolation Specs, Chrome Security Architecture, WHATWG

### 31.1. Cross-Origin Complete Isolation Model (COOP / COEP / CORP / OAC)

-   **Law**: Mandate complete implementation of all four cross-origin isolation mechanisms to fundamentally prevent Spectre vulnerabilities and cross-origin attacks. Required when using high-resolution timer APIs like SharedArrayBuffer and `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()`.

| Header/Feature | Value | Effect |
|:--------------|:------|:------|
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin` | Blocks `window.opener` references to/from cross-origin pages (prevents popup-based attacks) |
| `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` | `require-corp` | Blocks loading external resources without CORP/CORS headers |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` or `same-site` | Blocks cross-origin resource embedding |
| `Origin-Agent-Cluster` | `?1` | Assigns independent agent clusters per origin (document isolation) |

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Configure full cross-origin isolation in Next.js
// next.config.ts
const securityHeaders = [
  { key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',   value: 'same-origin' },
  { key: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', value: 'require-corp' },
  { key: 'Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy', value: 'same-origin' },
  { key: 'Origin-Agent-Cluster',         value: '?1' },
];
```

-   **Note**: `COEP: require-corp` requires CORP/CORS headers on all sub-resources, so verify compatibility with third-party resources. Recommend starting with `COEP: credentialless` (allows unauthenticated resources) and migrating gradually.

### 31.2. Speculation Rules API Security

-   **Law**: Prefetching/prerendering via the Speculation Rules API (Chrome 103+) can trigger pre-access to unauthenticated resources and early server-side log triggers.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Exclude Auth-Required Pages**: Do not include authenticated pages (dashboard, payment confirmation, etc.) in `speculationrules`.
    2.  **Restrict Eager Speculation**: Use `eagerness: "moderate"` or `"conservative"`. `"eager"` is prohibited in production by default.
    3.  **Duplicate Log Mitigation**: If prerendering causes duplicate access logs (GA/Analytics), implement exclusion logic using the `document.prerendering` API.

```json
// ✅ CORRECT: Restrictive Speculation Rules
{
  "prefetch": [{
    "source": "list",
    "urls": ["/public-article-1", "/public-article-2"],
    "eagerness": "moderate"
  }]
}

// ❌ PROHIBITED: Aggressive speculation including auth pages
{
  "prerender": [{
    "source": "document",
    "eagerness": "eager",
    "where": { "href_matches": "/*" }  // All-page targeting is prohibited
  }]
}
```

### 31.3. Document-Isolation-Policy

-   **Law**: `Document-Isolation-Policy: isolate-and-require-corp` introduced in Chrome 128+ is recommended as preparation for a future standard header.

### 31.4. Advanced Clickjacking Prevention

-   **Law**: `X-Frame-Options` is a legacy approach. Prioritize CSP `frame-ancestors` directive for more granular control.

```
# ✅ CORRECT: Clickjacking prevention via CSP frame-ancestors
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';  # Block all embedding
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://trusted-parent.example.com;  # Allow only specific origins
```

-   **Cross-Reference**: §12.1 (Security Headers), §22.1 (DOM XSS Defense)

-   **Law**: Mandate L1 (minimum required) compliance with OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) v2.0 for all mobile apps. L2 is recommended for high-risk apps (finance, healthcare).

| Category | Core Controls |
|:--------|:--------------|
| **MASVS-STORAGE** | No hardcoded secrets. Sensitive data must be stored in Keychain/Keystore |
| **MASVS-CRYPTO** | No prohibited algorithms (MD5, DES, etc.). Prefer platform-provided APIs |
| **MASVS-AUTH** | Biometric authentication must be server-confirmed, not local-only |
| **MASVS-NETWORK** | Implement Certificate Pinning or SCT validation. Prohibit HTTP communication |
| **MASVS-PLATFORM** | Deep Link validation. Intent sniffing countermeasures. Hardened WebView config |
| **MASVS-CODE** | No debug builds in production releases. Code obfuscation |

    1.  **iOS**: Store sensitive data in Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` to prevent iCloud sync. Storing secrets in UserDefaults is **prohibited**.
    2.  **Android**: Store sensitive data in Android Keystore system. Storing secrets in SharedPreferences is **prohibited**.
    3.  **SQLite Database Encryption**: Use SQLCipher to encrypt offline databases.
    4.  **Exclude from Backups**: Use `android:allowBackup="false"` or backup rules to exclude sensitive data. iOS: Use `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`.

### 32.3. Certificate Pinning

-   **Law**: Implement Certificate Pinning for critical API communications to prevent MitM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.
-   **Recommended Approach**: Pin the SPKI (Subject Public Key Info) fingerprint (easier to update than pinning the full certificate).
-   **Backup Pins Required**: Prepare at least 2 pins as backup for when one pin is revoked.
-   **OTA Update Mechanism**: Enable OTA updates of pin information so responses can be made without forced app updates.

```kotlin
// ✅ Android: OkHttp Certificate Pinning example
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .certificatePinner(
        CertificatePinner.Builder()
            .add("api.example.com", "sha256/primaryPinHash=")   // Primary
            .add("api.example.com", "sha256/backupPinHash=")    // Backup
            .build()
    )
    .build()
```

### 32.4. Root / Jailbreak Detection

-   **Law**: For high-risk apps (finance, healthcare), detect Root/Jailbreak environments and implement feature restrictions or user warnings.
-   **Detection Methods**:
    1.  **iOS Jailbreak Detection**: Path checks (`cydia://`, `/Applications/Cydia.app`, `/usr/sbin/sshd`) + Spring Board read attempt + `fork()` success check.
    2.  **Android Root Detection**: `su` binary existence check + `BUILD_TAGS` `test-keys` check + Magisk/SuperSU path checks.
-   **Disclaimer**: "Perfect" detection is impossible. Attackers have evasion techniques. Position detection as one layer in defense-in-depth—do not rely on it exclusively.

### 32.5. Deep Link / Universal Link Security

-   **Law**: Prohibit processing parameters received via deep links without validation.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **iOS Universal Links**: Validate via `apple-app-site-association` file. Recommend deprecating unauthenticated custom URL schemes.
    2.  **Android App Links**: Validate via `assetlinks.json`. Set `android:autoVerify="true"`.
    3.  **Parameter Validation**: Validate all parameters received from deep links as rigorously as server-side validation.
    4.  **Authentication State Verification**: Re-verify authentication/authorization at the deep link destination. Prohibit processing that assumes already-authenticated state.

### 32.6. WebView Security

-   **Law**: WebViews in mobile apps are a primary attack surface. Mandate strict configuration.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Minimize JavaScriptInterface**: Minimize use of `@JavascriptInterface` annotation. Scrutinize and audit all exposed methods.
    2.  **Prohibit `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`**: Maintain `false` (default).
    3.  **URL Allowlist**: Restrict navigation within WebView to company-owned domains only. Open external URLs in external browser.
    4.  **CSP Application**: Apply CSP headers to WebView content as well.
    5.  **Cache Clear**: Fully clear WebView cache and cookies on logout.

### 32.7. Biometric Authentication Security

-   **Law**: Biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID, etc.) can be used for local authentication convenience but **must not replace server-side authentication for critical operations**.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Cryptographic Operation Binding**: On biometric success, release the private key from Keychain/Keystore and have the server verify the challenge signature (prohibit local-flag-only determination).
    2.  **Fallback Management**: Design PIN/password fallback at the same security level.
    3.  **No Biometric Data Storage**: Prohibit the app from storing biometric data itself. Use platform APIs only.

-   **Cross-Reference**: §4.2 (MFA), §5 (Passkey), §16 (Cryptography Policy)

## §34. AI/LLM Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing ★NEW

> **Reference**: Microsoft AI Red Team (AIRT), NIST AI RMF 1.0, OWASP LLM Top 10:2025, MITRE ATLAS

### 34.1. Mandating AI Red Teaming

-   **Law**: Mandate **AI Red Team exercises** for all LLM/AI features before production deployment. Systematically verify AI-system-specific attack methods (Prompt Injection, Jailbreak, data exfiltration) the same way as technical penetration testing.
-   **Rationale**: Traditional software testing misses AI-specific non-deterministic and emergent behavior. AI systems can cause unexpected safety issues depending on input, making dedicated Red Teaming essential.

### 34.2. Red Teaming Scope Definition

| Test Domain | Methodology | Pass Criteria |
|:-----------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Prompt Injection Resilience** | Direct, indirect, and multi-turn injection | All 10 standard attack patterns blocked |
| **Jailbreak Resilience** | DAN, GCG, Crescendo, Many-shot, etc. | Safe output maintained against 95%+ of known patterns |
| **Data Exfiltration Resilience** | System prompt / training data extraction attempts | Zero sensitive information leaked |
| **Harmful Content Generation** | Illegal content, discrimination, violence-inducing prompts | Harmful output rate < 1% |
| **Agency Abuse** | Unauthorized tool calls, privilege escalation attempts | Zero destructive operations without approval flow |
| **Hallucination / Misinformation** | Error rate on factually verifiable questions | Major misinformation rate < 5% |

### 34.3. Automated Red Teaming Toolchain

-   **Law**: Manual-only Red Teaming lacks sufficient coverage. Combine with automation tools and integrate into CI/CD.
-   **Recommended Tools**:

| Tool | Function | Integration Target |
|:-----|:---------|:------------------|
| **PyRIT (Microsoft)** | Python-based AI Red Teaming framework | CI/CD pipeline |
| **Garak** | LLM vulnerability scanner. 100+ probes | Pre-deploy gate |
| **promptfoo** | Prompt evaluation & regression testing | Dev environment / CI |
| **MITRE ATLAS Navigator** | Threat tactic mapping | Design / threat modeling |

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Automated Red Teaming with PyRIT
from pyrit.orchestrator import PromptSendingOrchestrator
from pyrit.prompt_target import AzureOpenAIChatTarget
from pyrit.datasets import fetch_harmbench_examples

async def run_ai_red_team(endpoint: str, api_key: str):
    target = AzureOpenAIChatTarget(
        deployment_name="gpt-4",
        endpoint=endpoint,
        api_key=api_key,
    )
    orchestrator = PromptSendingOrchestrator(prompt_target=target)
    
    # Auto-test with HarmBench standard dataset
    harm_examples = fetch_harmbench_examples()
    results = await orchestrator.send_prompts_async(
        prompt_list=[e['prompt'] for e in harm_examples[:100]]
    )
    
    # Calculate harmful output rate
    harmful_count = sum(1 for r in results if r.is_harmful)
    harmful_rate = harmful_count / len(results)
    assert harmful_rate < 0.01, f"Harmful output rate {harmful_rate:.2%} exceeds threshold"
```

### 34.4. AI Threat Model Matrix (MITRE ATLAS Reference)

-   **Law**: Model AI-specific attack tactics referencing the MITRE ATLAS framework and define risk priority.

| ATLAS Tactic | Corresponding AI Threat | Countermeasure |
|:------------|:----------------------|:--------------|
| **ML Attack Staging** | White-box attacks based on public models | Model non-disclosure + Transfer attack resilience |
| **Reconnaissance** | Probing model capabilities and input formats | Limit information disclosure in API responses |
| **Resource Development** | Building attack prompt datasets | Anomalous query pattern detection |
| **Initial Access** | Injecting malicious files/URLs into LLM | Content filtering + sandbox |
| **Execution** | Abusing code generation/execution features | Restrict code execution to isolated sandboxes |
| **Exfiltration** | Extracting training data / prompts | Output monitoring + Differential Privacy |

### 34.5. Continuous Red Teaming Cycle

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Pre-deploy Red Team**: Full-scope Red Teaming before production deployment (all domains in §34.2).
    2.  **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate `garak` or `promptfoo` into CI/CD gates; auto-execute on significant prompt changes.
    3.  **Monthly Regression**: Monthly regression testing of standard attack patterns after model updates or prompt changes.
    4.  **Discovery→Fix Cycle**: Record vulnerabilities found via Red Teaming with MITRE ATLAS tactic IDs; confirm non-reproducibility with PoC after remediation.
    5.  **External Red Team**: Mandate annual external Red Teaming by an AI-specialized security firm for high-risk AI systems (medical diagnosis, financial decisions).

-   **Cross-Reference**: §17 (AI/LLM Security), §17.13 (Adversarial Attacks on LLMs), §18 (Agentic AI)

## §35. Multi-Tenant & Tenant Isolation Security ★NEW

> **Reference**: OWASP Cloud Top 10, NIST SP 800-204 (Microservice Security), CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v4

### 35.1. Tenant Isolation Model Selection

-   **Law**: Clearly define the tenant isolation strategy in SaaS architecture and document the security boundaries of the selected isolation model.

| Isolation Model | Description | Security Level | Cost |
|:--------------|:-----------|:--------------|:-----|
| **Silo (Full Isolation)** | Independent infrastructure per tenant | Highest (design-time isolation) | High |
| **Pool (Shared Infrastructure)** | Shared DB instance/tables | Application isolation | Medium (implementation-dependent) | Low |
| **Bridge (Hybrid)** | Compute/Network as Silo, DB as Pool (RLS isolation) | High | Medium |

-   **Recommendation**: SaaS handling sensitive data (medical, financial, legal) should adopt Silo or Bridge model. Pool model requires RLS Hard Isolation (§35.3).

### 35.2. Tenant ID Management

-   **Law**: Explicitly assign tenant context to all data and requests, reducing tenant boundary ambiguity to zero.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Tenant ID Source of Truth**: Use the `tenant_id` claim in authentication tokens (JWT) as the sole authority. Accepting tenant IDs from URL parameters or request body is **prohibited** (BOLA prevention).
    2.  **Tenant ID Validation Middleware**: Implement unified middleware that extracts and validates tenant ID at the entry of all API requests.
    3.  **Cross-Tenant Access Detection**: Detect mismatches between authenticated tenant ID and the tenant ID of the target resource; immediately deny and record in audit log.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Tenant ID validation middleware
export async function tenantGuard(
  request: Request,
  context: { tenantId: string }
): Promise<void> {
  const jwt = await verifyJWT(request.headers.get('Authorization'));
  const tokenTenantId = jwt.claims['tenant_id'];
  
  // Mismatch between JWT tenant_id and context is a cross-tenant attack
  if (tokenTenantId !== context.tenantId) {
    await auditLog({ event: 'CROSS_TENANT_ATTEMPT', actor: jwt.sub, tenantId: context.tenantId });
    throw new ForbiddenError('Cross-tenant access denied');
  }
}

// ❌ PROHIBITED: Anti-pattern of trusting tenant ID from URL
export async function badHandler(req: Request) {
  const tenantId = req.url.searchParams.get('tenant_id'); // ← Can be tampered
  return db.query(`SELECT * FROM data WHERE tenant_id = '${tenantId}'`);
}
```

### 35.3. Data Layer Tenant Isolation (Hard Isolation)

-   **Law**: Enforce tenant boundaries at the database level, designing so that application layer bugs cannot lead to cross-tenant data leakage.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Enforce RLS (Row Level Security)**: Mandate RLS policies (e.g., `tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')`) on all tables (integrated with §12.3).
    2.  **Connection Pool Isolation**: Guarantee proper scope via DB connection isolation per tenant or Set Role/Search Path configuration.
    3.  **Batch Processing Tenant Boundary**: Batch jobs/schedulers must explicitly include tenant ID as a filter condition; prohibit bulk access to all-tenant data.
    4.  **Storage Bucket Isolation**: In object storage, enforce `tenantId/` prefix and restrict signed URL scope to tenant path.

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Tenant isolation via RLS
CREATE POLICY "Tenant isolation"
  ON public.documents
  FOR ALL
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);

-- Setting tenant context in application layer
SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant_id', $1, true); -- Valid only within transaction
```

### 35.4. Cross-Tenant Shared Resource Control

-   **Law**: Structurally prevent cross-tenant data mixing in shared infrastructure (cache, message queues, CDN, etc.).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Cache Key Prefix**: Design cache keys in `tenant:{tenantId}:{resource}` format. Prohibit storing data in generic keys without tenant ID.
    2.  **Message Queue Isolation**: Always include tenant ID in queue messages and validate on the consumer side.
    3.  **Per-Tenant Rate Limiting**: Apply **per-tenant** rate limits rather than global. Design so a single tenant's excessive requests do not impact others.
    4.  **Log Isolation**: Always include tenant ID in audit logs; implement access control so tenant admins can only view their own tenant's logs.

### 35.5. Tenant Configuration & Customization Security

-   **Law**: Clarify boundaries so that system configuration changes by tenant admins do not affect the security of other tenants or the entire platform.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Configuration Scope Validation**: Strictly define the scope of settings a tenant admin can change; make platform-wide settings (global rate limits, auth infrastructure, etc.) structurally immutable.
    2.  **Custom Code Isolation**: Execute tenant-specific custom code (Webhooks, Plugins) in a sandbox environment; prohibit access to the platform core.
    3.  **Complete Data Deletion on Termination**: On tenant cancellation/deletion, automatically execute complete deletion of all data (DB, storage, cache, backups, logs) and issue deletion certificates.

-   **Cross-Reference**: §10.1 (BOLA Defense), §12.3 (RLS), §7.3 (PII Sensitivity Classification)

## §36. FinTech Security & PCI DSS 4.0 ★NEW

> **Reference**: PCI DSS v4.0 (Full migration March 2024), FAPI 2.0 (Financial-grade API), Open Banking Security Profile

### 36.1. PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance Requirements

-   **Law**: Systems that process, store, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) must mandate full compliance with PCI DSS v4.0. As of March 31, 2024, v3.2.1 is retired and v4.0 is the sole valid standard.

| Requirement Group | Key Requirements | Reference Section |
|:-----------------|:---------------|:----------------|
| **Req 1-2: Network Protection** | FW rule documentation, default setting changes | §13 |
| **Req 3-4: CHD Protection** | PAN encryption/masking, TLS 1.2+ enforcement | §16, §7.5 |
| **Req 5-6: Vulnerability Management** | Malware protection, secure development | §11, §19 |
| **Req 7-9: Access Control** | RBAC, MFA, physical security | §4, §33 |
| **Req 10-11: Monitoring & Testing** | Audit logs, penetration testing | §25, §24 |
| **Req 12: Policy Management** | Security policies, risk assessment | §29 |

### 36.2. PCI DSS 4.0 New Requirements (Effective 2025)

-   **Law**: Complete compliance with the "best practice requirements" of PCI DSS 4.0 (effective March 31, 2025).

| New/Enhanced Requirement | Content | Response Action |
|:------------------------|:--------|:---------------|
| **Req 6.4.3** | Manage, authorize, and implement SRI for all scripts on payment pages | Strengthen PCI DSS compliance in §22.2 |
| **Req 11.6.1** | Change detection mechanism for payment page HTTP headers and scripts | Introduce Change Detection system |
| **Req 8.2.8** | 15-minute idle timeout (management console) | Integrate into session management in §6.1 |
| **Req 8.4.2** | Expand MFA to all users (admins only → all CHD environment access users) | Expand MFA scope in §4.2 |
| **Req 10.7.2** | Automatic detection of security control failures | Integration with §26 SIEM/SOAR |
| **Req 12.3.2** | Customized approach (purpose-based compliance assessment) | Compliance documentation |

### 36.3. Cardholder Data (CHD) Protection

-   **Law**: Apply the highest level of protection when storing, processing, or transmitting PANs.
-   **PAN Protection Rules**:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: PAN display masking (show only first 6 and last 4 digits)
function maskPAN(pan: string): string {
  if (pan.length < 10) return '****';
  return `${pan.slice(0, 6)}${'*'.repeat(pan.length - 10)}${pan.slice(-4)}`;
  // Example: 4111111111111111 → 411111******1111
}

// ❌ PROHIBITED: Store full PAN in logs or DB
console.log('Payment processed:', { pan: '4111111111111111' }); // Absolutely prohibited
```

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Avoid PAN Storage**: Do not store PANs where possible (tokenize and manage via Card Token Vault).
    2.  **PAN Truncation**: If storage is necessary, do not store the full PAN (first 6 digits + last 4 digits maximum).
    3.  **Strong Cryptography**: Use AES-256 (§16.2) for PAN storage.
    4.  **CVV/CVC Non-Storage**: Storing CVV/CVC codes is **absolutely prohibited per PCI DSS**. Destroy immediately after authentication.
    5.  **Card Skimming Prevention**: Fully comply with Req 6.4.3/11.6.1 to prevent PANs from being stolen via Formjacking (form tampering) attacks.

### 36.4. Payment Page Tampering Detection (Req 11.6.1)

-   **Law**: Implement a system to detect unauthorized changes to HTTP response headers and script content on payment pages in real-time.
-   **Action**:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Payment page integrity monitoring (Req 11.6.1 compliance)
const PAYMENT_PAGE_BASELINE = {
  scripts: [
    { src: 'https://js.stripe.com/v3/', hash: 'sha384-KNOWN_HASH' },
    { src: '/payment.js', hash: 'sha384-OUR_HASH' },
  ],
  headers: {
    'Content-Security-Policy': 'expected-csp-value',
    'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  }
};

// Periodically (e.g., hourly) fetch payment page and detect diff
async function checkPaymentPageIntegrity(): Promise<void> {
  const response = await fetch('https://example.com/checkout');
  const currentCSP = response.headers.get('Content-Security-Policy');
  
  if (currentCSP !== PAYMENT_PAGE_BASELINE.headers['Content-Security-Policy']) {
    await alertSecurityTeam({ incident: 'PAYMENT_PAGE_HEADER_MODIFICATION', severity: 'P1' });
  }
}
```

### 36.5. Financial-grade API (FAPI 2.0) Security

-   **Law**: Mandate compliance with the **FAPI 2.0 Security Profile** when implementing financial APIs such as Open Banking or BNPL.
-   **FAPI 2.0 Mandatory Requirements**:

| Requirement | Content | Reference Section |
|:-----------|:--------|:----------------|
| **mTLS Sender Constraint** | Bind access tokens to client certificate | §4.10 (mTLS) |
| **PAR Required** | Send authorization requests from back-channel | §4.10 (PAR) |
| **RAR Usage** | Specify fine-grained authorization details via `authorization_details` | §4.10 (RAR) |
| **DPoP Recommended** | Sender-Constraint alternative where mTLS is unavailable | §4.10 (DPoP) |
| **`nonce` Required** | Replay attack prevention | §4.10 |
| **Short-Lived Access Tokens** | Limit access token validity to maximum 5 minutes | §6.1 |

### 36.6. Fraud Detection & Transaction Monitoring

-   **Law**: Detect financial fraud and unauthorized use through real-time transaction monitoring.
-   **Detection Patterns**:
    1.  **Velocity Check**: High volume of payment attempts in short time (detection of card testing attacks).
    2.  **Amount Anomaly**: Amounts statistically deviating from user's normal payment amounts.
    3.  **Geographic Anomaly**: Transactions diverging from recent physical location.
    4.  **High-Value Payment from New Device**: Combined detection of first-time device + high-value payment.
    5.  **Bin Attack**: Mass attempts on card BIN numbers (CVV brute force).

-   **Action**: Implement machine-learning-based real-time scoring (e.g., Stripe Radar, Adyen RevenueProtect, in-house ML models) and automatically reject or require additional authentication when score threshold is exceeded.

-   **Cross-Reference**: §4.10 (OAuth 2.1/DPoP/mTLS), §6.2 (Step-Up Authentication), §25.2 (Business Logic Security)

## §37. Kubernetes/eBPF/Cloud Native Advanced Security ★NEW

> **Reference**: CNCF Security White Paper v2, CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide, Cilium/Tetragon Official Documentation

### 37.1. eBPF-Based Runtime Security

-   **Law**: Implement runtime security monitoring leveraging eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology for container workloads on Kubernetes. Achieve lower overhead and higher visibility than traditional sidecar-based agents.
-   **Background**: Traditional runtime security tools like Falco rely on uprobes/kprobes and can only observe a subset of kernel events, whereas eBPF can observe all kernel syscalls with minimal overhead. Tetragon (a CNCF project) can **enforce security policies at the kernel level** via eBPF.

| eBPF Security Tool | Functionality | Use Case |
|:------------------|:-------------|:---------|
| **Tetragon (Cilium)** | Syscall-level runtime observability and policy enforcement | Detect unauthorized process launches and file access |
| **Cilium** | eBPF-based network policy (L3/L4/L7) | Kubernetes Network Policy hardening |
| **Falco + eBPF probe** | Managed eBPF probe-based rule detection | Backward compatibility for legacy environments |
| **KubeArmor** | eBPF-based container behavior control | System call restriction via LSM/eBPF |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Tetragon Installation**: Deploy Tetragon via Helm and enable ProcessExec, TCP, and DNS observability.
    2.  **TracingPolicy Definitions**: Define TracingPolicies to detect and deny unauthorized syscalls (`setuid`, `ptrace`, `bpf`, etc.).
    3.  **Network Observability**: Enable Cilium's Hubble UI to visualize and monitor pod-to-pod traffic at L7 level.
    4.  **Alert Integration**: Forward Tetragon events to SIEM (§26) via falcosidekick.

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT: Tetragon TracingPolicy example (block unauthorized setuid)
apiVersion: cilium.io/v1alpha1
kind: TracingPolicy
metadata:
  name: "block-setuid"
spec:
  kprobes:
  - call: "sys_setuid"
    syscall: true
    args:
    - index: 0
      type: "int"
    selectors:
    - matchBinaries:
      - operator: "NotIn"
        values:
        - "/usr/bin/sudo"
      matchActions:
      - action: Sigkill  # Immediately terminate unauthorized setuid
```

### 37.2. Kubernetes RBAC Fine-Grained Control

-   **Law**: Strictly apply the least privilege principle to Kubernetes RBAC and prohibit excessive `ClusterRole` assignments.
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Binding `cluster-admin` ClusterRole to application Service Accounts.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Namespace-Scoped Roles**: Prefer `Role` over `ClusterRole` wherever possible to constrain authority to the namespace.
    2.  **Verb Minimization**: Do not grant broad permissions (`create`, `update`, `delete`) to SAs that only need `get`, `list`, `watch`.
    3.  **RBAC Auditing**: Periodically inventory SA permissions with `kubectl auth can-i --list --as=system:serviceaccount:{namespace}:{sa}`.
    4.  **Rbac-police**: Integrate with OPA/Gatekeeper to block excessive RBAC configurations at Admission time.

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT: Minimum-privilege RBAC bound to Service Account
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: production
  name: app-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "configmaps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]  # Read-only

---
# ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Assigning cluster-admin
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin  # Absolutely prohibited
```

### 37.3. Secrets Store CSI Driver (External Secret Injection)

-   **Law**: Kubernetes native Secrets are merely base64-encoded and risk plaintext storage in etcd. In production, dynamically inject secrets via CSI from external secret stores.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Secrets Store CSI Driver**: Integrate with HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault / GCP Secret Manager to inject secrets into Pod filesystems as CSI volumes.
    2.  **etcd Encryption**: Encrypt Secrets/ConfigMaps in etcd via `EncryptionConfiguration` using AES-GCM/AES-CBC.
    3.  **External Secrets Operator**: In GitOps environments, use External Secrets Operator to sync external secrets as Kubernetes Secrets (restrict replica retrieval with ACLs).

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT: Secrets Store CSI Driver (Vault integration example)
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: vault-database-creds
spec:
  provider: vault
  parameters:
    vaultAddress: "https://vault.internal:8200"
    roleName: "app-role"
    objects: |
      - objectName: "db-password"
        secretPath: "secret/data/database"
        secretKey: "password"
```

### 37.4. Workload Identity (Service Account Token Projection)

-   **Law**: When Kubernetes workloads access cloud APIs (AWS/GCP/Azure), use **Workload Identity** (IRSA/Workload Identity Federation) for short-lived tokens instead of static credentials.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **AWS IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)**: Annotate Pod Service Accounts with IAM Role ARNs. Authenticate via `AWS_ROLE_ARN` environment variable and token mount.
    2.  **GKE Workload Identity**: Bind GCP Service Accounts 1-to-1 with k8s Service Accounts. Eliminate static keyfiles.
    3.  **Azure Workload Identity**: Use Managed Identity to authenticate Pods directly to Azure AD.
    4.  **Short-Lived Tokens**: Set Projected Service Account Token expiry to a maximum of 1 hour (`expirationSeconds: 3600`).

### 37.5. Security Context Hardening

-   **Law**: Building on §14.2 (Pod Security Standards), define fine-grained security contexts per workload.
-   **Minimum Requirements Checklist**:

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT: Hardened securityContext (all fields)
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 65534       # nobody UID
    runAsGroup: 65534
    fsGroup: 65534
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault  # seccomp enforcement (Kubernetes 1.25+)
  containers:
  - name: app
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop: ["ALL"]
      seccompProfile:
        type: Localhost       # Custom seccomp profile
        localhostProfile: "profiles/app.json"
```

## §38. AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) ★NEW

> **Reference**: OWASP LLM Top 10:2025, NIST AI RMF 1.0, EU AI Act Art.9, Gartner AI-SPM Definition

### 38.1. AI-SPM Overview and Mandate

-   **Law**: Introduce an **AI-SPM** process to continuously discover, assess, and improve the security posture of all AI/LLM systems operating within the organization. Just as DSPM targets data security, AI-SPM targets AI systems.
-   **Background**: As of 2026, the number of AI systems within organizations is rapidly growing, and unauthorized AI tools (Shadow AI), vulnerable model configurations, and excessive AI permissions are primary risks. Ahead of EU AI Act's full enforcement in 2026, AI system inventory management and risk classification are becoming legal obligations.

### 38.2. AI System Inventory

-   **Law**: Systematically inventory all AI systems operated or used within the organization, clarifying ownership, risk level, and compliance status.

| Inventory Item | Information Collected | Purpose |
|:--------------|:---------------------|:--------|
| **System Basics** | Name, purpose, owner, model in use | Enabling tracking and accountability |
| **EU AI Act Risk Class** | Prohibited/High-risk/Limited-risk/Minimal-risk | Determining regulatory applicability |
| **Data Classification** | PII sensitivity of data processed | DPIA trigger determination |
| **Access Control State** | Presence of authentication/authorization | Security gap detection |
| **Dependent Model/API** | LLM provider and model version | Supply chain risk management |
| **Guardrail Implementation** | Presence of I/O filters and test results | Safety assurance verification |

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Automated Discovery List**: Add an AI system registration step to CI/CD pipelines. Manage `llm-inventory` YAML (`name`, `model`, `owner`, `risk_class`, `pii_processed`) in the repository.
    2.  **Shadow AI Detection**: Detect unauthorized access to OpenAI API/Claude API/Gemini API, etc. via network monitoring. Monitor traffic to endpoints like `api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com` with DLP/CASB (see §8.2, §2.3).
    3.  **Quarterly Inventory**: Update the AI system catalog quarterly. Revoke residual credentials from decommissioned systems.

### 38.3. AI Risk Scoring

-   **Law**: Quantitatively assess security risk for each AI system and respond based on priority.

| Risk Factor | Score (0-10) | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
| **Data Sensitivity** | 0-3 | High PII/PHI processing = high score |
| **Decision Impact** | 0-3 | High autonomy and high impact = high score |
| **Guardrail Implementation** | 0-2 | Unimplemented = high score (penalty) |
| **Red Team Status** | 0-2 | Not conducted = high score (penalty) |

-   **Alert Thresholds**:
    -   Score **7+**: Critical — Immediate response required. Consider suspending production operation until Red Teaming is complete.
    -   Score **5-6**: High — Implement mitigations within 72 hours.
    -   Score **3-4**: Medium — Planned response within the next sprint.

### 38.4. AI System Access Control Review

-   **Law**: Periodically review the permissions, data access, and external connections held by AI systems based on Zero Trust principles (§2).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Enforce Least Privilege**: Inventory AI system (especially Agentic AI) tool and API scopes quarterly. Immediately remove unnecessary permissions (see §18.2).
    2.  **API Key Rotation**: Rotate LLM provider API keys within 90 days (see §6.7).
    3.  **Network Egress Control**: Restrict AI agent external communications to whitelisted destinations. Auto-block access to unauthorized endpoints.
    4.  **HITL Re-evaluation**: Quarterly review of HITL requirements for high-risk AI systems; assess appropriateness of automation scope.

### 38.5. Continuous AI Compliance Monitoring

-   **Law**: Continuously monitor AI system compliance status against legal requirements such as EU AI Act Annex IX.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Automated Conformity Checks**: Based on EU AI Act risk classification (Art.6/7), automatically check implementation status of logging, technical documentation, and human oversight required for high-risk AI systems.
    2.  **DPIA Integration**: Trigger re-execution of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) when the risk class of PII-processing AI systems changes.
    3.  **Drift Detection**: Detect changes to AI system model versions and prompt configurations; automatically trigger compliance re-assessment workflows.

## §29. Security Governance


> **Reference**: NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern Function), ISO 27001, COBIT

### 29.1. Governance Framework

-   **Law**: Integrate security risk management into Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Use NIST CSF 2.0 Govern function as the reference framework.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Organizational Context**: Document business objectives, regulatory requirements, and risk environment; reflect in security strategy.
    2.  **Security Strategy**: Define risk appetite (acceptable risk levels) and reflect in security investment prioritization.
    3.  **Roles and Responsibilities**: Define RACI matrix for security decision-makers, executors, consultees, and informees.

### 29.2. Risk Appetite Definition

| Risk Level | Definition | Response Policy |
|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| **Critical** | Fatal impact on business continuity | Immediate response. Risk acceptance not permitted |
| **High** | Major financial/legal/reputational damage | Implement mitigation within 72 hours |
| **Medium** | Limited impact | Planned response |
| **Low** | Minor impact | Continue monitoring. Acceptable |

### 29.3. Security Budget & Resources

-   **Guideline**: Recommend allocating **10-15%** of IT budget to security (NIST/industry standard).
-   **Priority Investment Areas**: IAM, threat detection & incident response, security automation, security education & training.

### 29.4. Executive Reporting

-   **Law**: Establish regular security status reporting to executives/board of directors.
-   **Report Content**: Security metrics dashboard (§24.4 KPI summary), key risks and status, incident summary, compliance status, security investment ROI.
-   **Frequency**: Quarterly + ad-hoc reporting for significant incidents.

### 29.5. Policy Management

-   **Law**: Regularly review and update security policies to prevent obsolescence.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Annual Review**: Mandate annual review of all security policies.
    2.  **Trigger-Based Updates**: Immediate policy updates on significant incidents, regulatory changes, or tech stack changes.
    3.  **Version Control**: Maintain version history of policy documents.
    4.  **Communication Obligation**: Ensure communication and acknowledgment from all stakeholders on policy changes.

### 29.6. Compliance Auditing

-   **Law**: Conduct regular internal/external security audits to ensure compliance.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Internal Audit**: Semi-annual security configuration and operations self-assessment.
    2.  **External Audit**: Recommend annual third-party security audit (SOC 2 Type II, etc.).
    3.  **Remediation**: Develop remediation plans within 30 days of audit findings, complete within 90 days.

## Language-Specific Security

### TypeScript / JavaScript

-   `eval()`, `Function()`, `new Function()` usage is **completely prohibited**.
-   `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` / `v-html` requires **special PR review approval**.
-   Minimize `any` type usage. Use `unknown` + Zod for input validation.
-   Enforce secret retrieval via `process.env`. Direct values prohibited.
-   Enforce `===` strict equality (prohibit `==`).

### Python

-   Passing untrusted data to `pickle.loads()` is **absolutely prohibited** (arbitrary code execution risk).
-   `subprocess.call(shell=True)` prohibited. Use `subprocess.run()` + list arguments.
-   `os.system()` prohibited.
-   Use `yaml.safe_load()`. `yaml.load()` is **prohibited**.
-   Be cautious of direct user input expansion in `format()` / f-strings. Template injection countermeasures.

### Go

-   Use `html/template` (`text/template` lacks XSS protection).
-   Use `crypto/rand` (`math/rand` is unsuitable for cryptographic use).
-   Use `database/sql` placeholders for SQL queries (string concatenation prohibited).
-   Prevent goroutine resource leaks (`context.WithTimeout` / `context.WithCancel`).

### SQL

-   `SELECT *` prohibited. Explicitly specify only needed columns.
-   Dynamic SQL prohibited. Use parameterized queries only.
-   `GRANT ALL` prohibited. Grant only necessary permissions individually.
-   `SECURITY DEFINER` functions must include `SET search_path = public`.

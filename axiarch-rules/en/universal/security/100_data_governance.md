## §3. Data Sovereignty & Cross-Border Transfer

### 3.1. Data Residency
-   **Rule 3.1.1**: Store user data in the region where the user resides.
-   **Rule 3.1.2**: Guarantee that PII is not persisted outside designated regions, including CDN caches and temporary files.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md` §8.2 (Data Residency)

### 3.2. Data Portability
-   **Export Right**: Users have the right to download all their data in a machine-readable format (JSON/CSV).
-   **SLA**: Maintain capability to provide data within **72 hours** of a disclosure request. Implement via async jobs.
-   **Export Frequency Limit**: Export requests limited to **2 per month**. Notify next available date when exceeded.
-   **Import**: Provide bulk import functionality in CSV/JSON format.
    -   **Validation Pipeline**: Pass all type checks, duplicate checks (`ON CONFLICT`), and UTF-8 normalization **before** saving.
    -   **Error Report**: Failed rows reported with line numbers and detailed error messages.
    -   **Dry Run Mode**: Validation-only mode before production writes recommended.

### 3.3. Right to Erasure
-   **Rule 3.3.1**: Account deletion must **hard delete** all related PII, making recovery impossible.
-   **Rule 3.3.2**: Only data with legal retention obligations may be isolated in Cold Storage. Hard delete after retention period.
-   **Rule 3.3.3**: SARs must be completed within **30 days** of receipt.
-   **Rule 3.3.4**: Cascade deletion order across related tables must be explicitly managed in the Service layer.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md` §4.5 (Right to be Forgotten)

### 3.4. Cross-Border Transfer Framework

| Mechanism | Use Case | Requirements |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| **Adequacy Decision** | Japan-EU, Japan-UK, etc. | Destination country recognized as providing adequate protection |
| **SCC** | Transfers to non-adequate countries | Execution of EU Standard Contractual Clauses + TIA |
| **BCR** | Intra-group transfers | Supervisory authority approval |
| **CBPR** | APEC region | CBPR certification |
| **Explicit Consent** | Individual cases | Last resort. Not suitable for repetitive transfers |

#### 3.4.1. Data Localization Requirements (by Country)

| Country | Localization Requirement | Cross-Border Conditions | Sanction Risk |
|:--------|:------------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------|
| **China** | CIIOs must store personal info & important data **domestically** | Security assessment / SCC / Certification + individual consent | 5% revenue or RMB 50M |
| **Russia** | Personal data collection & storage must be on **domestic DB** | Foreign DB use prohibited | High fines |
| **Vietnam** | "Important data" and "core data" stored domestically | Impact assessment + authority approval | 5% revenue (2026) |
| **India** | SDF must store certain categories domestically. RBI mandates payment data localization | Whitelist approach | ₹250 crore |

-   **Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)** — CNIL 2025.1 Final Guidelines 6-Step Methodology:
    1.  **Know Your Transfer**: Identify the data being transferred, parties involved (exporter/importer), and transfer context
    2.  **Identify Transfer Tool**: Determine which GDPR Art.46 mechanism (SCC/BCR, etc.) is being used
    3.  **Assess Third-Country Laws & Practices**: Evaluate the destination country's legal framework (both written laws and actual practices). Focus on government data access risks (surveillance legislation, etc.)
    4.  **Identify & Adopt Supplementary Measures**: Where protection gaps exist, adopt technical (encryption, pseudonymization), contractual, and organizational supplementary measures
    5.  **Implement & Document**: Document all assessment results, adopted measures, and decision rationale. Preserve as audit evidence
    6.  **Re-evaluate Periodically**: Re-evaluate **at least annually** or upon significant changes in law, new risks, or data usage changes
-   **Anti-Pattern**: "We signed SCCs so TIA is unnecessary" is wrong. SCCs require TIA and supplementary measures as prerequisites.
-   **EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)**: Adequacy decision 2023.7. In 2025.9, the EU General Court dismissed a challenge to the DPF, providing temporary stability. However, noyb has indicated intent to re-challenge. TIA is still recommended even when relying on DPF.
-   **UK Adequacy Extension**: EU-UK adequacy decision extended to **December 2031** (draft decision 2025.10). European Commission confirmed adequacy following DUAA impact assessment.

### 3.5. Data Processing Standards
-   **Pseudonymized Information**: Processed so individuals cannot be identified without combining other information. Relaxed internal analysis use. Third-party provision prohibited in principle.
-   **Anonymized Information**: Processed so re-identification is impossible. Third-party provision allowed without consent. Processing standards, publication obligations, and re-identification prohibition must be strictly observed.
-   **Usage Guide**: Internal analysis/product improvement → Pseudonymized / External provision/open data → Anonymized.

### 3.6. DSAR Automation Workflow

| Step | Processing | Automation Level |
|:-----|:----------|:----------------|
| **1. Intake** | Centralized intake via web form / API / email | Fully automated |
| **2. Identity Verification** | Tiered authentication (logged in → immediate / unauthenticated → email + ID verification) | Semi-automated |
| **3. Data Search** | Automated PII search across all data stores (DB, S3, logs, backups) | Fully automated |
| **4. Review & Redaction** | Automated third-party PII masking + human review | Semi-automated |
| **5. Response Preparation** | Auto-packaging in compliant format (JSON/CSV/PDF) | Fully automated |
| **6. Delivery** | Auto-delivery of encrypted download link | Fully automated |
| **7. Audit Log** | Immutable log of all operations (tamper-proof) | Fully automated |

-   **SLA Management**: Auto-track statutory deadlines per request type with alerts firing 5 days before deadline:
    -   GDPR: **30 days** (extension +60 days with justification notification)
    -   CCPA/CPRA: **45 days** (extension +45 days)
    -   Global Privacy Laws: **30 days** (obligation to respond promptly)
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Relying on CS team manual email handling for DSARs will fail at scale.

#### 3.6.1. DSAR API Design Pattern

```typescript
// DSAR Intake API Endpoint Design
interface DSARRequest {
  requestType: 'access' | 'deletion' | 'correction' | 'portability' | 'opt-out';
  subjectId: string;         // User ID or email
  jurisdiction: 'GDPR' | 'CCPA' | 'Global Privacy Laws' | 'LGPD' | 'PIPA';
  verificationMethod: 'authenticated' | 'email' | 'id_document';
  requestedAt: string;       // ISO 8601
}

interface DSARResponse {
  requestId: string;         // UUID v4
  status: 'received' | 'verified' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'rejected';
  deadlineAt: string;        // Auto-calculated per jurisdiction
  estimatedCompletionAt: string;
}

// Auto-calculate statutory deadlines
const DSAR_DEADLINES: Record<string, number> = {
  'GDPR': 30,    // 30 days (extendable +60 days)
  'CCPA': 45,    // 45 days (extendable +45 days)
  'Global Privacy Laws': 30,    // 30 days
  'LGPD': 15,    // 15 days
  'PIPA': 10,    // 10 days
};

function calculateDeadline(jurisdiction: string, requestedAt: Date): Date {
  const days = DSAR_DEADLINES[jurisdiction] ?? 30;
  const deadline = new Date(requestedAt);
  deadline.setDate(deadline.getDate() + days);
  return deadline;
}
```

-   **Mandate**: DSAR API must record all operations as immutable logs, preserving audit trails.

### 3.7. Automated Decision-Making & Profiling
-   **Law**: GDPR Art.22 guarantees the right to object to **fully automated decision-making** with legal or similarly significant effects. CCPA/CPRA enforces ADMT regulation from 2026.1.
-   **Requirements**:
    -   **Pre-disclosure** of automated decision existence, logic involved, and anticipated outcomes
    -   Guarantee users' **right to request human review**
    -   **Opt-out right**: CCPA/CPRA adds opt-out rights for profiling-based automated decisions
-   **CCPA ADMT Rules (2026.1 effective)**:
    -   Targets technology that "substantially replaces human decision-making"
    -   New processing activities must complete risk assessment **before** initiation
    -   Pre-existing activities must complete risk assessment by **2027.12.31**
-   **Colorado AI Act (2026.6 effective)**:
    -   Targets AI systems making "consequential decisions" (financial, housing, insurance, healthcare, education, employment, etc.)
    -   Deployers: Must build and maintain risk management programs aligned with NIST AI RMF or ISO 42001
    -   Deployers: Complete impact assessment before deployment + annual updates (or within 90 days of substantial modifications)
    -   Consumer disclosure obligation: Notify that AI is involved in decision-making and provide appeal methods
-   **Implementation Pattern**:

```typescript
// Automated decision transparency flag
interface AutomatedDecision {
  decision_id: string;
  decision_type: 'credit_scoring' | 'content_recommendation' | 'pricing';
  is_fully_automated: boolean;
  logic_summary: string; // Plain language explanation for users
  human_review_requested: boolean;
  opt_out_available: boolean;
}
```

#### 3.7.1. Right to Explanation & Algorithmic Transparency Requirements
-   **EU AI Act Art.86**: Individuals affected by decisions from high-risk AI systems have the right to receive **clear and meaningful explanations** of the AI system's role, key decision factors, and decision rationale.
-   **GDPR Art.13-15**: Obligation to provide meaningful information about "the logic involved, its significance, and the envisaged consequences" of automated processing.
-   **XAI (Explainable AI) Implementation Checklist**:
    -   [ ] XAI methods (SHAP / LIME, etc.) integrated to extract model decision factors
    -   [ ] UI providing explanations in **plain language** for end users
    -   [ ] Explanations have sufficient specificity to "identify violations and file complaints"
    -   [ ] Explanation generation/delivery process recorded as audit logs
    -   [ ] Explanation consistency validated upon model updates
-   **Anti-Pattern**: "The algorithm is too complex to explain" is legally unacceptable. Technical complexity is the organization's problem and does not justify limiting data subject rights.

---

## §4. Consent Management & CMP

### 4.1. CMP Implementation Mandate
-   **Mandate**: Manage cookie and tracking consent using a trusted CMP (e.g., OneTrust) that auto-adapts to regulatory changes per jurisdiction.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md` §4.12 (Cookie Consent Technical Implementation)

### 4.2. Strict Opt-In
-   **Rule 4.2.1**: All tracking beyond essential cookies must be **blocked** without explicit user consent. No nudging.
-   **Rule 4.2.2**: "Reject All" must have **equal visibility** to "Accept All" on consent banners.

#### 4.2.1. Consent Management API Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// --- Consent Management API Endpoint Design ---
// POST   /api/v1/consents          - Create consent record
// GET    /api/v1/consents/:userId   - Get user consent state
// PATCH  /api/v1/consents/:userId   - Update consent state (partial revocation, etc.)
// DELETE /api/v1/consents/:userId   - Revoke all consents

interface ConsentRecord {
  userId: string;
  consents: {
    category: 'necessary' | 'analytics' | 'marketing' | 'personalization';
    granted: boolean;
    grantedAt: string | null;     // ISO 8601
    revokedAt: string | null;
    legalBasis: 'consent' | 'legitimate_interest' | 'contract';
    policyVersion: string;       // Policy version at time of consent
  }[];
  metadata: {
    ipAddress: string;           // Store hashed
    userAgent: string;
    jurisdiction: string;        // Auto-detected from GeoIP
    consentMethod: 'banner' | 'settings' | 'api';
  };
}
```

```typescript
// --- Server-Side Consent Enforcement Middleware ---
import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function consentMiddleware(req: NextRequest): NextResponse {
  const consentCookie = req.cookies.get('consent_state');
  const consent = consentCookie
    ? JSON.parse(consentCookie.value)
    : { analytics: false, marketing: false };

  // Block tracking scripts without consent
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Consent-Analytics', String(consent.analytics));
  response.headers.set('X-Consent-Marketing', String(consent.marketing));

  // Block third-party scripts via CSP when no consent
  if (!consent.marketing) {
    const csp = response.headers.get('Content-Security-Policy') || '';
    response.headers.set(
      'Content-Security-Policy',
      `${csp}; script-src 'self'` // Exclude marketing script domains
    );
  }
  return response;
}
```

-   **Mandate**: Consent state must be managed in DB; cookies are only client-side cache. Server-side enforcement must always be implemented.
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md` (CSP configuration)

### 4.3. Cookie Classification & Consent Requirements

| Category | Examples | Consent |
|:---------|:---------|:--------|
| **Essential** | Session ID, CSRF token | Not required (service operation) |
| **Functional** | Language, theme preferences | Not required (user convenience) |
| **Analytics** | Analytics, heatmaps | **Required** |
| **Advertising** | Ad serving, retargeting | **Required** |

### 4.4. CMP Implementation Standards
-   **Initial State**: Analytics and advertising cookies **disabled** on first visit. Enabled only after explicit consent.
-   **Banner UI**: Provide 3 options: "Accept All", "Customize", "Reject".
-   **Persistence**: Store consent state in DB or LocalStorage. Do not re-display banner on return visits.
-   **Consent Withdrawal**: Ensure accessible pathway (e.g., footer link) for users to withdraw consent at any time.
-   **Server-Side Recording**: Record consent state server-side and maintain audit trail.
-   **Mandate**: Default is "Reject All". Only enable categories actively consented to by the user.

### 4.7. GDPR Digital Omnibus Reform (2025.11 Proposal)

> [!NOTE]
> The Digital Omnibus Package does not "replace" the GDPR but aims to "harmonize, clarify, and simplify" it. Under review by the European Parliament and Council. Comply with current rules until enacted.

#### 4.7.1. Cookie Consent Simplification
-   **One-Click Reject**: Mandatory implementation of one-click "Reject All" in cookie banners expected. Must have equal prominence to "Accept All".
-   **Consent Exemption Expansion**: **Audience measurement cookies** and **security maintenance cookies** exempt from consent. Targeting/advertising cookies still require consent.
-   **Re-Request Restriction**: Re-requesting consent from users who rejected is **prohibited for 6 months**.
-   **Cookie Violation Fines**: Cookie-related violation fines aligned to GDPR levels (max €20M / 4% global turnover).
-   **Centralized Settings Concept**: Proposal for users to manage cookie settings centrally via browser settings, simplifying per-site banner displays.

#### 4.7.2. "Personal Data" Definition Clarification
-   **Entity-Specific Identifiability Test**: Assess identifiability per entity based on "means reasonably likely to be used." Codifies the CJEU SRB judgment.
-   **Pseudonymized Data Clarification**: Controllers can assess when pseudonymized data falls outside GDPR scope for specific entities. Impacts analytics and AI pipelines.
-   **Engineering Impact**: Document pseudonymization processing flows and establish re-identification risk assessment processes.

#### 4.7.3. DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) Reform
-   **New Abuse Refusal Ground**: When data subjects abuse DSARs for purposes unrelated to data protection, refusal or reasonable fee charging becomes possible.
-   **Action**: Add abuse determination process to DSAR processing flows. Exercise caution with criteria to avoid wrongly refusing legitimate requests.

#### 4.7.4. AI Data Processing Legitimate Interest Clarification
-   **Legitimate Interest for AI Development**: Legitimate interest applicable as legal basis for personal data processing in AI development/operation (subject to balancing test).
-   **Special Category Data**: New conditions introduced for processing special category data (SCD) in AI development/operation.
-   **Anti-Pattern**: "Digital Omnibus freed AI training" is wrong. Balancing test and transparency obligations remain mandatory.

#### 4.7.5. Data Breach Notification Changes
-   **Threshold Elevation**: DPA notification threshold raised from "risk" to "**high risk**".
-   **Deadline Extension**: 72 hours → **96 hours** extension proposed.
-   **One-Stop Notification**: **Single notification entry point** proposed for multi-regime scenarios.

#### 4.7.6. DPIA Harmonization
-   **EU-Wide Guidance Harmonization**: Harmonize DPIA requirements across the EU. Proposes unified list of processing activities requiring DPIA and a **standard template**.

-   **Mandate**: As this is a proposal, comply with current rules until enacted. However, equal-prominence "Reject All" button is already mandated by current Rule 4.2.2. Monitor Digital Omnibus developments **quarterly** and begin implementation preparation for enactment.

### 4.5. Cookieless Tracking Legal Status
-   **Browser Fingerprinting**: Under ePrivacy Directive, subject to **same consent obligations** as cookies. Fingerprinting without consent is illegal.
-   **Server-Side Tagging**: Server-side tags also require consent when processing personal data. "Server-side means no consent needed" is **wrong**.
-   **Privacy Sandbox API Retirement (2025.10)**: Google **discontinued** Topics API, Protected Audience, Attribution Reporting, and IP Protection. Low adoption and ecosystem feedback drove the decision.
    -   **Continuing APIs**: CHIPS (partitioned cookies), FedCM (federated credential management), Private State Tokens (fraud prevention) remain.
    -   **Engineering Impact**: Implementations dependent on Privacy Sandbox **must immediately migrate to first-party data strategies**.
-   **Google Cookie Deprecation Reversal (2025.4)**: Google officially reversed the complete third-party cookie phase-out plan. Transitioning to user-choice model in Chrome settings.
    -   **Reality**: Safari/Firefox already block by default. Approximately 30-40% of all users are in cookie-blocked environments.
    -   **Mandate**: Default to data collection and advertising designs that do not assume cookie availability. Prioritize first-party data and contextual advertising.
    -   **Anti-Pattern**: "Google reversed, so cookie dependency is fine" is wrong. Cookieless trend is irreversible from both regulatory and browser specification perspectives.
-   **UK DUAA 2025**: UK relaxes consent requirements for low-risk analytics cookies (notice + opt-out). Marketing cookies still require consent. Cookie violation fines raised to GDPR levels (max £17.5M / 4% global turnover).
-   **GDPR Digital Omnibus (Q4 2025 proposal)**: Proposes cookie consent simplification and SME exemption expansion. Comply with current rules until enacted.

### 4.6. Third-Party Script Governance
-   **Principle**: Third-party JS/SDKs must **not load at all** until the user consents to the relevant category.
-   **Tag Manager Rules**: When using GTM etc., implement consent-status-based tag firing control integrated with CMP.
-   **Vendor Contracts**: Specify data collection scope, purpose, and retention period in DPA (§13) when onboarding third-party SDKs.
-   **Audit**: Audit actually-loaded scripts quarterly to detect unauthorized script injection.

### 4.8. Universal Opt-Out Mechanism (GPC) Implementation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal recognition is a **legal obligation** in multiple US states. Mandatory in California under CCPA/CPRA since 2023. Connecticut and Oregon also mandatory from January 2026.

-   **Definition**: GPC is a technical specification that allows users to broadcast a "do not sell/share" preference via browser settings (`Sec-GPC: 1` header).
-   **Mandatory States (as of 2026)**: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas
-   **Implementation Requirements**:

```typescript
// --- GPC Signal Detection Middleware ---
import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function gpcMiddleware(req: NextRequest): NextResponse {
  const gpcSignal = req.headers.get('Sec-GPC');
  const response = NextResponse.next();

  if (gpcSignal === '1') {
    // GPC signal detected: treat as opt-out
    response.headers.set('X-GPC-Honored', 'true');

    // 1. Disable targeted advertising cookies
    // 2. Stop third-party data sharing
    // 3. Record "do not sell/share" state in DB
    // 4. Set analytics cookie consent conservatively
  }

  return response;
}
```

-   **Mandate**: When a GPC signal is received, process it as an opt-out **without requiring additional user action**. "Ignoring GPC and requesting re-confirmation via banner" is illegal.
-   **Cross-Reference**: §6.3.2 (US State Laws), §4.2 (Strict Opt-In)

    -   Technical lead, legal/compliance officer, user representative
-   **Scope**: Model selection, prompt policy changes, new AI feature risk assessment, incident response.
-   **Cadence**: Quarterly reviews + emergency ad-hoc convening.
-   **AI Literacy Mandate**: Deliver AI literacy training to all employees involved in AI-related work (EU AI Act Art.4, **effective 2025.2**).

### 11.10. GenAI Hallucination Liability
-   **Risk**: Hallucinations create legal liability, defamation, and regulatory violation risks.
-   **Countermeasures**:
    -   **Prohibit** using GenAI output directly as official information
    -   **Mandatory disclaimer** "Responses may be inaccurate" for user-facing AI features
    -   Secure **indemnification clauses**, liability demarcation, and training data opt-out rights in GenAI provider contracts
-   **GDPR Risk**: AI generating inaccurate information about individuals may violate GDPR **Art.5(1)(d)** (data accuracy principle).

## §12. Data Lifecycle Management

### 12.1. Engagement Data Retention Standards

| Data Type | Retention Period | Post-Expiry Action |
|:----------|:----------------|:------------------|
| **Favorites / Bookmarks** | Indefinite | Hard delete upon account deletion |
| **Browsing History** | Last **90 days** | Monthly batch hard delete |
| **Operation Logs** | Last **1 year** | Legally mandated items archived separately |

| **Payment Data** | **Statutory 7 years** | Delete after statutory period |
| **Campaign Data** | Within **90 days** post-end | Hard delete |

-   **Mandate**: Specific retention periods per data type defined in Blueprint. This protocol provides the "template."

### 12.2. Content Archival Standards
-   **Closed Service Entities**: Change status to `closed`/`archived` and exclude from search. Retain related UGC permanently.
-   **Deleted User Content**: Set `owner_id: null`. Retain content with public interest.
-   **Dormant Data**: Auto-notify administrators of archival suggestions for non-public content unchanged for 2+ years.

### 12.3. Automated Cleanup
-   **Mandate**: Auto-execute periodic cleanup jobs via `pg_cron` / Cloud Scheduler etc.

```sql
-- pg_cron automated cleanup job example
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-browsing-history',
  '0 3 * * 0', -- Every Sunday 03:00 UTC
  $$DELETE FROM browsing_history WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'$$
);
```

-   **Anonymization Obligation**: When deletion is legally difficult, perform **irreversible anonymization**. Hashing alone is insufficient.

### 12.4. Jurisdiction-Specific Data Retention Period Template

| Data Category | GDPR (EU) | CCPA/CPRA (CA) | Applicable Regional Law | Common Recommendation |
|:-------------|:----------|:--------------|:-----------|:---------------------|
| **Customer Account Info** | Until purpose achieved + 3 years post-deletion | Disclosure obligation: 12 months | Until purpose achieved | **Max 3 years** post-deletion |
| **Transaction/Payment Data** | Statutory period (tax: 7 years) | Statutory period | Statutory period (tax: 7 years) | **Per statutory period** |
| **Marketing Consent** | Until revocation + 3 years evidence | Immediate stop after opt-out | Until revocation | Evidence for **5 years** |
| **Access Logs** | Legitimate interest period (recommended: 6 months) | No requirement | Recommended: 1 year | **6 months to 1 year** |
| **CCTV/Surveillance** | 72 hours to 30 days (varies by country) | No requirement | No requirement | **Max 30 days** |
| **Employee Data** | 3-10 years post-employment (varies) | Reasonable period post-employment | 3 years post-resignation (Labor Standards Act) | **Per statutory period** |
| **Health Data** | HIPAA: 6 years / GDPR: until purpose achieved | No requirement | Global Privacy Laws + Medical Law | **Per statutory period** |
| **Children's Data** | COPPA/GDPR: promptly delete after purpose achieved | COPPA: reasonable period | Global Privacy Laws: same | **Delete in shortest period** |

-   **Mandate**: Above is a template. Define specific values in Blueprint.
-   **CCPA/CPRA Disclosure Obligation**: Privacy policies must **publicly disclose** specific retention periods for each category.

#### 12.4.1. Litigation Hold
-   **Definition**: Legal obligation to **immediately suspend** routine deletion of relevant data when litigation, investigation, or regulatory action is reasonably anticipated.
-   **Triggers**: Litigation notice (preservation notice), regulatory investigation initiation notice, internal whistleblowing, audit notice.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  Legal team issues litigation hold notice
    2.  **Immediately suspend** auto-deletion jobs for affected data (`pg_cron` job disable, etc.)
    3.  Identify and document scope and location of affected data
    4.  Notify relevant parties of preservation obligations (send periodic reminders)
    5.  Hold release only by written approval from legal team
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Deleting data during a litigation hold constitutes **Spoliation**, resulting in sanctions and adverse inference.

// --- Incident Response Runbook: Notification Deadline Calculator ---
import { differenceInHours, addHours, format } from 'date-fns';

interface JurisdictionDeadline {
  jurisdiction: string;
  regulation: string;
  deadlineHours: number;
  authority: string;
  notificationUrl: string;
}

const NOTIFICATION_DEADLINES: JurisdictionDeadline[] = [
  { jurisdiction: 'EU/EEA', regulation: 'GDPR Art.33', deadlineHours: 72, authority: 'Lead DPA', notificationUrl: '' },
  { jurisdiction: 'Japan', regulation: 'Global Privacy Laws', deadlineHours: 72, authority: 'PPC', notificationUrl: 'https://www.ppc.go.jp/personalinfo/legal/leakAction/' },

    formattedDeadline: format(addHours(discoveryTime, d.deadlineHours), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm (zzz)'),
    remainingHours: d.deadlineHours - differenceInHours(new Date(), discoveryTime),
  })).sort((a, b) => a.deadlineHours - b.deadlineHours);
}
```

-   **Mandate**: Integrate the above deadline calculation logic into IR tools to **automatically compute notification deadlines across all jurisdictions** upon incident discovery, highlighting the jurisdiction with the shortest deadline.

## §16. Data Governance Organization

### 16.1. Mandatory Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Establishment Requirement |
|:-----|:----------------|:------------------------|
| **DPO** | Independent oversight of data protection law compliance, DPIA advisory, supervisory authority liaison | Mandatory when GDPR applies |
| **CPO** | Privacy strategy formulation & execution | Recommended based on business scale |
| **Data Steward** | Data quality management, metadata management | Recommended per domain |

### 16.2. ROPA
-   **Mandate**: Maintain GDPR Art.30 compliant Records of Processing Activities.
-   **Record Items**: Processing purpose, data categories, recipients, cross-border transfers, retention periods, security measures.
-   **Update Frequency**: Immediate update when new processing activities are added + **annual** full review.

### 16.3. Data Classification Framework

| Level | Definition | Handling Standards |
|:------|:----------|:-----------------|
| **Restricted** | Highest confidentiality (medical, financial, credentials) | Encryption mandatory, access logs, least privilege |
| **Confidential** | Business confidential (personal data, contracts) | Access restriction, encrypted transfer |
| **Internal** | Internal only | External sharing prohibited |
| **Public** | Public information | No restrictions |

### 16.4. Privacy Engineering Technical Patterns

-   **Data Minimization at Code Level**: Prohibit `SELECT *` and mandate explicit field selection.

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Select only necessary columns (Data Minimization)
const user = await supabase.from('profiles')
  .select('id, display_name, avatar_url')
  .eq('id', userId);
```

-   **PII Tagging in Schema**:

```sql
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.email IS '@pii:email';
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.phone IS '@pii:phone';
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.full_name IS '@pii:name';
```

-   **Automated PII Redaction in Logs**:

```typescript
function redactPII(data: Record<string, unknown>): Record<string, unknown> {
  const PII_KEYS = ['email', 'phone', 'full_name', 'address', 'ip_address'];
  return Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(data).map(([key, value]) =>
      PII_KEYS.includes(key) ? [key, '[REDACTED]'] : [key, value]
    )
  );
}
```

-   **Privacy-Preserving Computation**:

| Technology | Overview | Use Case |
|:-----------|:---------|:---------|
| **Differential Privacy (DP)** | Add statistical noise to prevent individual identification | Analytics dashboards, A/B testing |
| **Federated Learning (FL)** | Distributed learning without moving data | AI training under cross-border constraints |
| **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** | Compute on encrypted data | Data processing at vendor sites |
| **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** | Joint computation on private multi-party data | Benchmarks, cross-industry analysis |

### 16.5. Policy-as-Code
-   **Concept**: Define governance policies as machine-executable code and auto-verify in CI/CD.
-   **Applications**:
    -   Auto-detect PII based on schema comments (`@pii:*`)
    -   Block table creation without `retention_days` during migrations
    -   Auto-reconcile RLS policies with ROPA records
    -   Detect pre-consent tracking script loading in E2E tests

#### 16.5.1. CI/CD Privacy Check Pipeline Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/privacy-checks.yml
name: Privacy Compliance Checks
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  privacy-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: PII Schema Audit
        run: |
          # Detect personal data columns without @pii: tags
          grep -rn 'email\|phone\|full_name\|address\|ip_address' \
            supabase/migrations/ | grep -v '@pii:' && exit 1 || true

      - name: Retention Policy Check
        run: |
          # Block new table CREATEs without retention_days
          grep -l 'CREATE TABLE' supabase/migrations/*.sql | while read f; do
            grep -q 'retention_days' "$f" || \
              { echo "FAIL: $f missing retention_days"; exit 1; }
          done

      - name: Consent-Before-Tracking Test
        run: |
          # Detect pre-consent tracking scripts with Playwright
          npx playwright test tests/privacy/consent-enforcement.spec.ts
```

-   **Mandate**: All checks above must pass before PR merge. Block merge on failure.

#### 16.5.2. Governance Automation Pipeline
-   **Purpose**: Extend Policy-as-Code to fully automate data governance verification.
-   **Implementation Layers**:

| Layer | Automation Target | Tool Examples |
|:------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| **Schema Layer** | PII tag coverage verification, retention period setting enforcement | CI/CD scripts, Open Policy Agent |
| **Access Control Layer** | Automated cross-referencing of RLS policies with ROPA | Custom linters, Supabase CLI |
| **Runtime Layer** | Pre-consent tracking script detection | Playwright E2E tests |
| **Audit Layer** | DSAR response deadline auto-alerts, retention period exceedance detection | Cron jobs, monitoring dashboards |

-   **Mandate**: Incorporate at minimum Schema Layer and Runtime Layer automation into CI/CD. Audit Layer should be deployed based on business scale.

### 16.6. Data Mapping & Data Flow Diagrams
-   **Mandate**: Create and maintain data flow diagrams for all processing activities including:
    -   Data collection points, storage locations, sharing destinations, retention periods, deletion triggers
-   **Update Frequency**: Update on new feature releases + **semi-annual** full inventory.

### 16.7. Data Ethics Framework
-   **Core Principles**: Transparency, fairness, purpose limitation, accountability, human-centricity
-   **Application**: Conduct "Newspaper Test" when designing data use for new features.

## §18. Law Enforcement Data Requests

### 18.1. Core Principles
-   All government/law enforcement data requests validated by legal for legal validity before response.
-   Unless prohibited by law, notify affected users before data disclosure.
-   Disclose only the minimum data necessary for the request.
-   **CLOUD Act**: US-based service providers may be required to disclose data stored overseas.

### 18.2. Request Classification & Response

| Request Type | Disclosure Scope | Legal Review | User Notification |
|:------------|:----------------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Voluntary Request** | Voluntary. Refusal permitted | Recommended | Permitted |
| **Subpoena** | Non-content data only | Mandatory | Permitted |
| **Search Warrant** | Including content | Mandatory | Typically prohibited |
| **NSL** | Restricted | Mandatory | Prohibited |

---

## §19. Legal Hold & eDiscovery

### 19.1. Legal Hold
-   **Law**: When litigation is reasonably anticipated, obligation to preserve relevant data arises. **Immediately suspend** auto-deletion policies (§12).
-   **Flow**:
    1.  Legal determines need for legal hold
    2.  Issue hold notices to relevant Custodians
    3.  Suspend auto-deletion jobs for affected data

name: Regulatory Change Tracking
schedule: 'weekly'
steps:
  1_monitor:
    sources:
      - GDPR / ePrivacy Official Journal
      - IAPP Daily Dashboard
      - National DPA Official Announcements
      - Legislative Bill Trackers
    output: raw_regulatory_changes

  2_classify:
    input: raw_regulatory_changes
    actions:
      - Auto-classify impact level (High / Medium / Low)
      - Auto-map to related sections (this file)
    output: classified_changes

  3_alert:
    input: classified_changes
    actions:
      - 'High': Immediate notification to legal team + DPO
      - 'Medium': Include in weekly summary
      - 'Low': Archive for quarterly review

  4_action:
    input: classified_changes (High/Medium)
    actions:
      - Auto-set deadline for technical response plan (within 30 days)
      - Propose additions to §2.3 timeline
```

-   **Mandate**: Regulatory change tracking must use **manual quarterly review** as a minimum, transitioning to **weekly automated monitoring** after tool adoption.

### 43.3. Compliance Automation Maturity Map

| Maturity | Manual → Automated | Target Domain | Tool Examples |
|:---------|:-------------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| **L1** | Manual | Regulatory review, DSAR email responses | Spreadsheets, email |

## §44. Data Trusts & Data Sharing Agreements

### 44.1. EU Data Governance Act & Data Altruism
-   **Law**: The EU Data Governance Act (DGA, effective 2023.9) establishes a legal framework for voluntary data sharing for public interest purposes (**Data Altruism**).
-   **Key Concepts**:

| Concept | Definition | Legal Basis |
|:--------|:-----------|:------------|
| **Data Altruism** | Voluntary provision of data for public interest purposes (scientific research, public health, etc.) | DGA Chapter IV |
| **Data Altruism Organization (DAO)** | Certified entity promoting data altruism activities | Under EU member state registration/supervision |
| **Data Intermediation Service** | Matching data holders with data users | DGA Chapter III, notification regime |
| **European Common Data Spaces** | Sector-specific data sharing ecosystems (health, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.) | Core of EU data strategy |

-   **Engineering Impact**: When participating in EU data spaces, incorporate data sharing API interfaces, access controls, and usage purpose traceability into design.

### 44.2. Data Trust Structure & Legal Framework
-   **Definition**: A Data Trust is a structure where an independent trustee manages data for the benefit of data providers based on trust law.
-   **Key Models**:

| Model | Characteristics | Use Cases |
|:------|:---------------|:----------|
| **Civic Data Trust** | Manages citizen data for public benefit | Smart cities, public health |
| **Commercial Data Trust** | Intermediates data sharing between enterprises | Cross-industry benchmarks |
| **Personal Data Trust** | Individuals entrust their data and delegate management | Collective management of personal data |

-   **Legal Considerations**: Trust law varies significantly by jurisdiction. The UK's Data Trust Pioneer project serves as a leading example. In Japan, METI's 2022 "Study on Data Transactions" provides reference.

### 44.3. Data Sharing Agreement Template Requirements
-   **Mandatory Clauses**:
    -   [ ] Clear definition of shared data scope and categories
    -   [ ] Purpose Limitation

## §45. Quantum Computing Threats & Cryptographic Agility

### 45.1. Threat Overview

> [!CAUTION]
> Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQC) are predicted to break current public-key cryptography within 10-20 years. **Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later (HNDL)** attacks are already underway, and countermeasures for sensitive data requiring long-term protection should be initiated **immediately**.

-   **Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later (HNDL)**: An attack strategy of collecting and storing currently encrypted data to decrypt it with quantum computers in the future. Likely already being executed at government level.
-   **Affected Cryptography**:

| Cipher | Impact | Current Use |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| **RSA** | ❌ **Broken** | TLS/SSL, digital signatures, key exchange |
| **ECDSA / ECDH** | ❌ **Broken** | TLS 1.3, cryptocurrency, code signing |
| **AES-256** | ⚠️ **Safe (key length halved equivalent)** | Symmetric encryption. AES-256 maintains AES-128 equivalent security under Grover's algorithm |
| **SHA-256** | ⚠️ **Safe (collision resistance reduced)** | Hashing. Collision search accelerated but sufficient preimage resistance |

### 45.2. NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards

| Standard | Algorithm | Type | NIST Published | Use Case |
|:---------|:----------|:-----|:---------------|:---------|
| **FIPS 203** | ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) | Key Encapsulation | 2024.8 | TLS key exchange (RSA/ECDH replacement) |
| **FIPS 204** | ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) | Digital Signature | 2024.8 | Code signing, authentication (ECDSA/RSA replacement) |
| **FIPS 205** | SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) | Stateless Signature | 2024.8 | Long-term document signing (alternative to stateful signatures) |
| **FIPS 206** | FN-DSA (FALCON) | Digital Signature | 2025 (in progress) | Compact signatures (bandwidth-constrained environments) |

### 45.3. Jurisdiction-Specific PQC Migration Mandates & Guidance

| Jurisdiction | Regulation/Guidance | Requirements | Deadline |
|:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------|:---------|
| **US** | NSM-10 (2022) + OMB M-23-02 | Federal government system PQC migration plan mandate | 2035 (phased) |
| **US** | CISA PQC Guidance | Recommends CRQC risk assessment and PQC migration roadmap for critical infrastructure | Recommended (mandate under consideration) |
| **EU** | ENISA PQC Report (2025) | Guidance for EU institution PQC migration roadmaps | Recommended |
| **France** | ANSSI (2024) | Recommends hybrid cryptography (PQC + traditional crypto combined) | Recommended |
| **Germany** | BSI (2024) | Recommends ML-KEM / ML-DSA for government use | Recommended |

### 45.4. Cryptographic Agility Governance Framework
-   **Definition**: **Cryptographic Agility** is the design property enabling cryptographic algorithm changes to be executed without large-scale system-wide modifications.
-   **Implementation Principles**:
    -   Manage cryptographic algorithms as **configuration parameters**, not hardcoded in code
    -   **Support multiple ciphersuites** in TLS configuration to facilitate PQC algorithm addition
    -   Attach **algorithm metadata** (cipher used, key length, version) to encrypted data
    -   Create and maintain a **CBOM (Cryptography Bill of Materials)** to visualize all cryptographic assets in use

```typescript
// Cryptographic Agility Design Pattern
interface CryptoConfig {
  keyEncapsulation: 'ML-KEM-768' | 'ML-KEM-1024' | 'X25519';
  digitalSignature: 'ML-DSA-65' | 'ML-DSA-87' | 'Ed25519';
  symmetricEncryption: 'AES-256-GCM';
  hashFunction: 'SHA-256' | 'SHA-3-256';
}

// Enable algorithm switching via environment variables
const cryptoConfig: CryptoConfig = {
  keyEncapsulation: (process.env.CRYPTO_KEM as CryptoConfig['keyEncapsulation']) || 'X25519',
  digitalSignature: (process.env.CRYPTO_SIG as CryptoConfig['digitalSignature']) || 'Ed25519',
  symmetricEncryption: 'AES-256-GCM',
  hashFunction: 'SHA-256',
};
```

### 45.5. PQC Migration Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Actions |
|:------|:---------|:--------|
| **Phase 1: Inventory** | Start immediately | Create CBOM. Inventory all cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and keys in use |
| **Phase 2: Risk Assessment** | Within 3 months | Assess HNDL risk. Identify data requiring long-term protection (health data, government data, etc.) |
| **Phase 3: Hybrid Migration** | 6-12 months | Introduce hybrid cryptography (PQC + traditional crypto combined) starting from high-risk areas |
| **Phase 4: Full PQC Migration** | 2030 target | Fully migrate all systems to PQC algorithms |

-   **Mandate**: Phase 1 (CBOM creation) must be started **immediately**. PQC migration planning is impossible without cryptographic asset visibility.
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Deferring countermeasures because "quantum computers are still far off." HNDL risk is **currently in progress**.

---

## Part I: Philosophy of Fundraising

### 1.1. The Three Errors of Fundraising

- **Rule 15.001**: The following are **dangerous anti-patterns**:

  | Anti-Pattern | Problem |
  |:--|:--|
  | **Fundraising as Validation** | Mistaking raise amount for success. VC money is no substitute for PMF |
  | **Raise as Much as Possible** | Over-capitalization expands dilution and erodes discipline. Burn Multiple worsens |
  | **Valuation Maximization** | Excessive valuation makes the next round and Exit harder (Down Round risk) |

### 1.2. Default Alive Principle

- **Rule 15.002**: Aim for **Default Alive** before raising (Paul Graham)
  - Default Alive = current growth and cost trajectory naturally reaches profitability
  - Raising while not Default Alive requires **explicit acknowledgment** of risk
- **Formula**: If `current monthly growth × 12-month compounding − Burn` is positive, you are Default Alive

### 1.3. Ramen Profitability First

- **Rule 15.003**: Reach **Ramen Profitability** (minimum survival without external capital) early
  - Founders' minimum cost-of-living covered
  - Creates a **strong negotiating position**; desperate is always disadvantaged

### 1.4. Burn Multiple Discipline

- **Rule 15.004**: **Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR** is the primary efficiency metric (David Sacks)

  | Burn Multiple | Assessment |
  |:--|:--|
  | < 1 | Amazing — every $ of burn produces > $ of ARR |
  | 1 – 1.5 | Great — efficient growth |
  | 1.5 – 2 | Good |
  | 2 – 3 | Suspect |
  | > 3 | Bad — cut burn rate immediately |

### 1.5. Post-ZIRP World (2022+)

- **Rule 15.005**: With ZIRP gone, the "Growth at All Costs" era ended. **Rule of 40** (Growth Rate + Profit Margin ≥ 40%) is the SaaS health-bar.
- **Capital Efficiency**: Teams achieving the same ARR with half the capital are the new winners.

### 1.6. Cross-References
- `product/000_product_strategy.md` Unit Economics (CAC/LTV)
- `product/300_revenue_monetization.md` ARR / NRR

---

## Part II: Stages & Timing

### 2.1. Stage-Specific Characteristics & Benchmarks

- **Rule 15.010**: Stages with achievement standards (2026 major startup hubs)

  | Stage | Raise Size | Benchmark | Investors | Pre-money Valuation |
  |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
  | **Pre-seed** | $300K–$1M | Idea + Team + Prototype | Angels / FFF / Pre-seed VC | $3M–$10M |
  | **Seed** | $1M–$5M | PMF signs + MRR $20K | Seed VC / Angels | $8M–$30M |
  | **Series A** | $5M–$25M | PMF confirmed + ARR $1M–$3M + 10%+ MoM | Series A VC | $30M–$100M |
  | **Series B** | $20M–$80M | Unit Economics confirmed + ARR $5M–$20M | Growth VC / CVC | $100M–$500M |
  | **Series C+** | $50M+ | Scale confirmed + market leadership | PE / Mega-VC | $500M–$5B |
  | **Pre-IPO** | $100M+ | Clear IPO path | Crossover / Mutual Funds | $1B+ |

### 2.2. Timing Laws

- **Rule 15.011**: Iron rules of timing:

```
1. Start working on it 12 months before you need it (closing takes 3–6 months)
2. Begin while you have 12+ months of runway
3. Move while you have strong momentum (growth numbers)
4. Desperate negotiating worsens terms

"Borrow when you have abundance; not when you need it"
```

### 2.3. Equity vs Debt vs Bootstrap

- **Rule 15.012**: Choose financing form by criteria:

  | Mode | Best Fit | Caveats |
  |:--|:--|:--|
  | **Equity** | High-growth requiring lump sum | Dilution / shareholder accountability |
  | **Debt (Loans)** | Stable cash flow | Repayment / collateral |
  | **Revenue-based Financing** | SaaS with stable MRR | Repayment terms warrant scrutiny |
  | **Venture Debt** | Already raised VC equity | Confirm Warrants / Covenants |
  | **Bootstrap** | Niche, high-margin / long-term ownership | Growth speed limited |
  | **Government (METI / JIC / NEDO)** | R&D / Deep Tech | Audit obligations / use restrictions |
  | **Crowdfunding (FUNDINNO etc.)** | Strong individual fanbase | Disclosure / operational cost |

### 2.4. Runway Calculation

- **Rule 15.013**: Runway = `cash on hand / monthly Net Burn`
  - **Net Burn** = monthly expense − monthly revenue
  - **Gross Burn** = monthly expense only
  - Use Net Burn in investor reports — don't fudge

### 2.5. Bridge Round Decision

- **Rule 15.014**: Criteria for Bridge Round (small raise to extend runway):
  - If you can hit the next round's KPIs within 6 months → Bridge OK
  - Otherwise prepare for **Down Round** or major burn cuts
  - Bridges are typically structured as SAFE / Convertible (avoiding valuation debate)

---

## Part III: Cap Table & ESOP Design

### 3.1. Cap Table Basics

- **Rule 15.020**: Maintain accurate Cap Table from **Day 1**. Move from manual Excel to Carta / Pulley early.
- **Cap Table Components**:
  - Founders (co-founder shares + Vesting Schedule)
  - Common Stock
  - Preferred Stock (Series A/B/C, etc.)
  - Option Pool (ESOP / Stock Options)
  - SAFE / Convertible Notes (unconverted)
  - Warrants (Venture Debt etc.)

### 3.2. Founder Vesting & Cliff

- **Rule 15.021**: All founder shares MUST follow **4-year Vesting + 1-year Cliff**
  - **Cliff**: 100% forfeit if leaving before year 1
  - **4-year Vesting**: After year 1, monthly 1/48 vests
  - **Acceleration**:
    - **Single Trigger**: Auto-vest unvested on M&A (founder-friendly)
    - **Double Trigger**: Auto-vest on M&A + termination (balanced; recommended)
- **Re-vesting on Round**: Sometimes demanded by Series A investors (resets existing Vesting)

### 3.3. ESOP (Employee Stock Option Plan) Design

- **Rule 15.022**: Design ESOP at the following sizes:

  | Stage | ESOP Size (% of Pre-money) |
  |:--|:--|
  | Pre-seed | 5–10% |
  | Seed | 10–15% |
  | Series A | 15–20% |
  | Series B | 18–22% |
  | Series C+ | 20–25% |
- **Option Pool Shuffle**: VCs requesting Option Pool expansion in Pre-money = "stealth dilution" of founders. Negotiate **Post-money expansion** instead.

### 3.4. Equity Composition Health Check

- **Rule 15.023**: Healthy ownership at Series A (typical US startup):

  | Party | Ownership (Post-Series A) |
  |:--|:--|
  | Founders (2–3 co-founders) | 50–65% |
  | Series A investors | 20–25% |
  | Seed investors | 10–15% |
  | ESOP (remaining) | 8–12% |

  Founder ownership below 40% creates control risk in Series B/C. Be mindful of Founder-Friendly structuring early.

### 3.5. Dilution Math

- **Rule 15.024**: Basic dilution calculation

```
Pre-money Valuation = $20M
New Investment = $5M
Post-money Valuation = $25M
New Investor Ownership = $5M / $25M = 20%
Existing Shareholder Dilution = 20% (1 - 80% = 20% reduction)
```

- **Pre-money vs Post-money SAFE / Note Impact**:
  - **Pre-money SAFE**: SAFE investors' ownership counted in Pre-money (further dilutes existing shareholders)
  - **Post-money SAFE (YC v2.0+)**: SAFE investors' ownership fixed → transparent calculation; current standard

### 3.6. Cap Table Tools (Mandatory)

- **Rule 15.025**: Manual Excel management is **forbidden after Seed**. Adopt one of:
  - **Carta** — US largest; ESOP / 409A / Secondary
  - **Pulley** — Carta competitor; price advantage
  - **Capdesk** — European
  - **Shareworks (Morgan Stanley)** — for large enterprises

### 3.7. 409A Valuation (US)

- **Rule 15.026**: For ESOP exercise price determination, US companies MUST obtain **409A Valuation** (independent appraisal) annually + after major events (IRS regulation). Carta automates this.

### 3.8. Cross-References
- `security/300_ip_due_diligence.md` Legal management of corporate / shareholder records
- `operations/200_hr_organization.md` HR / hiring / compensation design

---

## Part IV: SAFE / Convertible Note / Bridge

### 4.1. SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

- **Rule 15.030**: Adopt **SAFE v2.0+ (Post-money SAFE)** — Y Combinator standard. Pre-money SAFE is legacy.
- **Key SAFE Parameters**:

  | Parameter | Description |
  |:--|:--|
  | **Valuation Cap** | Maximum valuation at which SAFE converts (Cap or Discount applies) |
  | **Discount** | Discount on next round's valuation (typical 20%) |
  | **Most Favored Nation (MFN)** | Clause inheriting better terms from later SAFEs |
  | **Pro-rata Side Letter** | Right to participate in next round (separate agreement) |

### 4.2. SAFE Math Example

```
SAFE: $1M @ $10M Valuation Cap
Next Series A: $5M @ $20M Pre-money / $25M Post-money

SAFE investor's stake:
  Cap-applied: $1M / $10M = 10%
  Discount 20%-applied: $1M / ($25M × 0.8) = 5%
  → SAFE investor takes the better one (10%)
```

### 4.3. Convertible Note Comparison

| Feature | SAFE | Convertible Note |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Legal Form** | Equity reservation | Debt |
| **Interest** | None | 5–8% standard |
| **Maturity Date** | None | 18–24 months for conversion or repayment |
| **Simplicity** | ◎ | △ (interest, expiry) |
| **US Adoption** | Standard | Legacy |
| **Japan Adoption** | Growing | Standard (incl. J-KISS) |

### 4.4. KISS (Keep It Simple Security) / J-KISS

- **KISS** (500 Startups): Hybrid between SAFE and Convertible
- **J-KISS** (published by Coral Capital): Japan-law-compliant seed financing template
- **Usage**: US entity → SAFE; Japan entity → J-KISS is the modern standard

### 4.5. Bridge Financing

- **Rule 15.031**: Bridge Round (gap funding to next round) options:
  - **SAFE / Convertible Bridge**: Avoid valuation debate; resolved at next round
  - **Equity Bridge**: Additional investment from existing investors (same terms)
  - **Venture Debt Bridge**: From SVB / Hercules etc. (low default risk required)

### 4.6. Cross-References
- `product/300_revenue_monetization.md` Financial metrics like ARR

## Part V: Pitch Design Protocol

### 5.1. Standard 15-Slide Pitch Deck

- **Rule 15.040**: Standard pitch deck structure:

```
Required slides (10):
1. Cover (Company name / tagline / logo)
2. Problem (Definition / scale / Why Now)
3. Solution (Product / demo)
4. Market Size (TAM / SAM / SOM)
5. Business Model (Revenue mechanism / pricing)
6. Traction (Results / KPIs / growth chart)
7. Go-to-Market (Acquisition strategy)
8. Competition (Competitive comparison / positioning)
9. Team (Founder / key member backgrounds)
10. Financials (3-year forecast / raise amount / use of funds)

Appendix (5):
11. Unit Economics (CAC / LTV / Magic Number / Burn Multiple)
12. Product Roadmap
13. Customer Testimonials / Case Study
14. Technology / Architecture / Moat
15. Cap Table (current ownership) + Use of Funds
```

### 5.2. Traction Slide Design Principles

- **Rule 15.041**: Traction slide is **most important**

```
Good Traction Presentation:
✅ Emphasize growth rate (MoM 20% = 792% annualized)
✅ Show logos (well-known customers / brands)
✅ Combine quantitative + qualitative (NPS + MRR)
✅ Before/After to show customer success
✅ Cohort analysis (Retention curve)

Avoid:
❌ Absolute values only ("100K users" alone says nothing)
❌ Vanity Metrics (PV / DL only — show engagement)
❌ Cherry-picked windows (only-good-period selection)
❌ Misleading dual-axis charts
```

### 5.3. Narrative Design

- **Rule 15.042**: Design **a coherent narrative** for the pitch

```
Recommended Narrative (April Dunford / Andy Raskin style):
1. Why Now: Tech / market structural change
2. Problem: Issue created by the change
3. Solution: How we solve it
4. Traction: Evidence the market wants it
5. Vision: What world we're building in 5 years
6. Antagonist: Old-solution / competitor limitations (explicit)
```

### 5.4. Pitch Delivery Protocol

- **Rule 15.043**: Pitch meeting operations:
  - 30-min slot: Intro 5 / Presentation 10 / Q&A 15
  - **Demo video preferred**: 30-second video beats static screenshots
  - **Practice Q&A 100x** (Founder Pitch Trainer / Mock Pitch)
  - **In-person preferred**: Top VCs face-to-face; Zoom for round-2

### 5.5. Pitch Memo (Deck Alternative)

- **Rule 15.044**: Some VCs (Sequoia / a16z) request **Pitch Memo** (5–10 page prose).
  - Same heritage as Bezos's "no PowerPoint" philosophy
  - Conveys the rigor of thinking
  - Takes more prep than slides but content depth is greater

### 5.6. Cross-References
- `product/100_market_validation.md` Market Size / TAM calculation
- `product/200_go_to_market.md` GTM strategy

---

## Part VI: Investor Selection & Outreach

### 6.1. Investor List Construction Protocol

- **Rule 15.050**: Run outreach as **funnel management**:

```
Target: investor candidate list (200+)
  ↓ research
Qualified: aligned with stage/theme (50)
  ↓ confirm Warm Intro path
Priority: have intro routes (20)
  ↓ meeting
Meeting: first meetings (10)
  ↓ confirm interest
Active: deeper diligence (5)
  ↓ Term Sheet
Closing: term offers (1–3)
```

### 6.2. The Importance of Warm Intro

- **Rule 15.051**: Cold outreach reply rate is **<1%**. **Always go via Warm Intro**
  - Source priority: **Portfolio Founder > LP > Other VC > Advisor > Industry contact**
  - Cold is last resort

### 6.3. Investor Fit Evaluation

- **Rule 15.052**: Evaluate investors on these axes:

  | Axis | What to Confirm |
  |:--|:--|
  | **Thesis Fit** | Investment theme aligns with our stage / domain |
  | **Portfolio Value-add** | Portfolio contains potential customers / partners |
  | **Founder Reputation** | Reputation among portfolio founders (Reference Check) |
  | **Board Value** | What the investor brings as Board Member |
  | **Co-investment** | Willingness / track record of follow-on |
  | **Reserve Capital** | Follow-on investment headroom |

### 6.4. Investor Reference Check (DD on the investor)

- **Rule 15.053**: Before selecting a VC, **reference-check the investor**
  - Talk to 5 founders they invested in over the past 3 years (both successes and failures)
  - Probe "Tough-Time behavior", "contractual flexibility", "next-round follow-on"

### 6.5. AI-Assisted Investor Matching

- **Rule 15.054**: As of 2026, AI tools improve investor matching efficiency:
  - **Pitchbook**: fund focus / check size
  - **Crunchbase Pro**: stage / region filters
  - **OpenVC** / **VC Sheet** (community-driven): free-form search

## Part VII: Term Sheet Complete Guide (Math-Heavy)

### 7.1. Key Term Sheet Conditions

- **Rule 15.060**: Key conditions MUST be reviewed with **legal counsel**:

  | Condition | Founder-Friendly | Warning |
  |:--|:--|:--|
  | **Valuation (Pre/Post-money)** | Realistically high | Excessive triggers next-round risk |
  | **Liquidation Preference** | 1× Non-participating | 2×+ / Participating |
  | **Anti-dilution** | Broad-based Weighted Average | Full Ratchet |
  | **Pro-rata Rights** | Standard (investor follow-on) | OK |
  | **Board Composition** | Founder majority | Investor majority |
  | **Information Rights** | Monthly / quarterly | Excessively detailed |
  | **Founder Vesting Re-set** | None or with Acceleration | Full reset |
  | **Drag-along** | Standard (majority) | Minority-shareholder trigger |
  | **ROFR / ROFO** | Standard | Too broad |
  | **No-Shop / Exclusivity** | 30–45 days | 60+ days |

### 7.2. Liquidation Preference Math

- **Rule 15.061**: Example (Series A investor, $10M @ $30M Pre-money / $40M Post-money):

```
Exit Scenario A: Company sold for $30M
  1× Non-participating:
    Investor option: (a) $10M (Preference) or (b) 25% × $30M = $7.5M
    → Selects $10M
    Founders: $30M − $10M = $20M

  1× Participating:
    Investor: $10M + 25% × ($30M − $10M) = $10M + $5M = $15M
    Founders: $15M (worse)

  2× Non-participating:
    Investor option: (a) $20M or (b) $7.5M
    → Selects $20M
    Founders: $10M (worst)
```

- **Capped Participation**: Participating with a cap (e.g., 3× Cap) — hybrid.

### 7.3. Anti-Dilution Math

- **Rule 15.062**: Down-round Anti-dilution:

```
Scenario: Series A at $1/share, then Series B at $0.5/share (Down Round)
Series A investor's protections:

Full Ratchet (most investor-favorable):
  Series A's converted price reduces to $0.5
  → Series A share count doubles, founders dilute massively

Broad-based Weighted Average (standard / recommended):
  CP_new = CP_old × (A + B) / (A + C)
    A = shares outstanding
    B = new raise / CP_old
    C = new shares issued
  → Mild adjustment

Narrow-based Weighted Average:
  Excludes ESOP / Convertibles from denominator
  → More investor-favorable than Broad
```

### 7.4. Red Flag Term List

- **Rule 15.063**: Conditions to watch (require legal review):

```
Watch-list:
❌ Participating Preferred Stock (double-dip: preference + residual participation)
❌ 2x+ Liquidation Preference
❌ Full Ratchet Anti-dilution
❌ No Drag-along Right with weak founder protection
❌ Excessive investor control (hire/fire consent, key-decision veto)
❌ Aggressive Ratchet provisions
❌ Overly broad ROFR (restricting Secondary)
❌ No-Shop > 60 days
❌ Mandatory Re-vesting of all founders
```

### 7.5. Competing Offers Strategy

- **Rule 15.064**: Multiple simultaneous offers create **the strongest negotiating leverage**:
  - **FOMO Strategy**: Set deadline "decision by month-end as interest is rising"
  - **Competitive Tension**: Pit a specific VC against "best terms if others match"
  - **Ethical Line**: No fake numbers; no fabricated bids

## Part VIII: Due Diligence Response

### 8.1. Data Room Structure

- **Rule 15.070**: Maintain Data Room **at all times** to prepare for DD:

```
Recommended Data Room Structure:
├── Corporate/ (incorporation / shareholder roster / minutes / Cap Table)
├── Financials/ (monthly P&L / BS / CF / budget / 3-year plan)
├── Product/ (Product Roadmap / architecture diagram / Tech Stack)
├── Legal/ (contracts / IP rights / litigation risk / compliance)
├── HR/ (org chart / employment contracts / ESOP / Board composition)
├── Customers/ (customer list / MRR breakdown / Churn analysis / Cohort)
├── Technology/ (code quality / security / SOC 2)
├── Market/ (market research / competitive analysis / TAM/SAM/SOM)
├── References/ (customer / advisor / hiring-candidate references)
└── Press & Branding/ (past media coverage / brand assets)
```

### 8.2. DD Response Principles

- **Rule 15.071**: Three principles of DD disclosure:
  - **Proactive Disclosure**: Disclose problems **proactively**. Damage from concealment exposed later is far greater than disclosing
  - **Consistency**: Provide same info to all investors. No information asymmetry
  - **Completeness**: "Didn't know" is unacceptable. Have full grasp of own state

### 8.3. Data Room Tools

- **Rule 15.072**: Use dedicated tools:
  - **DocSend** — view history / dwell time / screenshot prevention
  - **Datasite** — enterprise DD
  - **Dropbox Capture** — simple
  - **Carta** — Cap Table-integrated Data Room
- **Anti-Pattern**: Sharing via Google Drive URL → leak risk; no audit trail

### 8.4. Common DD Landmines

- **Rule 15.073**: Common founder pitfalls:
  - **Verbal founder agreements**: Stock grants / terms not documented
  - **IP attribution from departed employees**: Employment contract lacks IP-assignment clause
  - **Open-source license violations**: GPL incorporated commercially, etc.
  - **PIPL / GDPR / US export controls**: Violations involving China / EU / restricted countries
  - **Unpaid taxes**: Consumption tax / corporate tax / withholdings

## Help Needed (request to investors)
- Hiring: looking for ◯◯ engineers
- Intro: please introduce ◯◯ industry customers
- Advice: want input on ◯◯ decision

## Hiring (status)

## Looking Ahead (next month focus)
```

### 9.2. Board Meeting Operations Protocol

- **Rule 15.081**: Run Board Meetings with this protocol:

```
Frequency: monthly (pre-Series A) / bimonthly (Series A+)
Board Pack distribution: 72 hours before meeting (48h minimum)
Structure:
  1. Performance review (KPI / financials) — 30%
  2. Major topic discussion — 40%
  3. Decisions needed — 20%
  4. Next Actions and owners — 10%

Forbidden: Surprises in Board Meetings. Communicate critical bad news in advance.
Recommended: Discuss assuming pre-read; do not read slides aloud.
```

### 9.3. Early Warning Protocol

- **Rule 15.082**: Notify all investors within **24 hours** when these critical events occur:

```
Early Warning Required:
- Runway expected to fall below 6 months
- Key Person (founder / CTO etc.) departure
- Major security incident
- Loss of major customer (>10% of MRR)
- Significant legal risk
- Major competitor move (acquisition / large raise)
- Regulatory change impacting business
- Founder mental-health issue (→ Part XIII)
```

### 9.4. Maintaining Investor Relationships

- **Rule 15.083**: Better investor relationships:
  - Quarterly 1-on-1 (large-check investors)
  - Annual Strategy Review
  - Birthday / holiday messages (human relationship)
  - Sharing failures (don't hide; convey lessons)

### 9.5. Annual Letter

- **Rule 15.084**: Year-end Investor Letter (PG / Brian Chesky style):
  - Year in review (wins / misses / lessons)
  - Next-year vision / strategy
  - Gratitude to investors
  - 4–8 pages of well-crafted prose

---

## Part X: Regulatory Compliance (FEFTA / CFIUS / MNPI / Tax / EDINET)

### 10.1. Foreign Investment Restrictions

- **Rule 15.090**: Regulatory checks when accepting foreign investors:

#### 10.1.1. Japan: FEFTA (Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act)

- Investments in **core technology areas** (semiconductors / quantum / AI / bio / cybersecurity etc.) by foreign investors require **prior notification**
- Notification triggered at 1% voting rights (some industries), 10%+ in principle
- **Action**: Especially relevant for Japan-incorporated startups preparing IPO

#### 10.1.2. US: CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment)

- Foreign investment (especially from China / Russia / North Korea / Iran) into US-incorporated / US-business companies triggers CFIUS review

## Part XI: IPO Preparation Protocol

### 11.1. IPO Preparation Period

- **Rule 15.100**: Typical IPO prep is **18–36 months**:

```
T-36 months: Target ARR $50M+, establish Path to Profitability
T-24 months: Select audit firm (Big 4 recommended), Audit-Ready Financials
T-18 months: Select Lead Bank, retain Legal Counsel
T-12 months: Build SOX Compliance, add independent directors
T-9 months: Begin S-1 draft (incl. Confidential Filing)
T-6 months: Complete Roadshow Pitch Deck, build IR team
T-3 months: Public Filing, begin Roadshow
T-0: Pricing → Listing
```

### 11.2. Listing Venue Selection

- **Rule 15.101**: Major listing venues:

  | Market | Size Guidance | Strengths | Cautions |
  |:--|:--|:--|:--|
  | **NYSE** | ARR $100M+ | Large-IPO / Brand prestige | Strict listing standards |
  | **NASDAQ** | ARR $50M+ | Tech home base | High liquidity |
  | **JPX Growth** | Tens of billions JPY | Japanese investor access | Lower foreign liquidity |
  | **JPX Standard** | Mid-cap | Japanese standard | |
  | **JPX Prime** | Large-cap | Highest status | Strict standards |
  | **HKEX** | Various | Asian access | Political risk |
  | **LSE / Euronext** | Various | European | |

### 11.3. S-1 / Form 1-A Preparation

- **Rule 15.102**: Major S-1 (US IPO prospectus) sections:

  - **MD&A**: Management's Discussion and Analysis
  - **Financials**: Audited 3 years

  - **Audit-Ready Financials**: audit trails for all transactions
  - **SoD (Segregation of Duties)**
  - **ITGC (IT General Controls)**: access / change / operations management
- **Action**: Build SOX team T-12 months out (CFO + Internal Audit Manager)

### 11.5. Direct Listing & SPAC Considerations

- **Rule 15.104**: Alternatives to traditional IPO:
  - **Direct Listing**: Existing shareholders sell directly on NYSE/NASDAQ (no Underwriter; Spotify / Slack used). No new capital
  - **SPAC merger**: Merge with existing public SPAC (peaked 2021; now ~1/10)
  - **When to use**: High notoriety + no need to raise = Direct Listing; speed = SPAC; standard = IPO

### 11.6. Lock-up & Greenshoe

- **Rule 15.105**:
  - **Lock-up**: 180-day post-IPO insider sale restriction (typical)
  - **Greenshoe Option**: Right for lead underwriter to issue additional 15% (price stabilization)
  - **Cliff Lock-up Expiration**: Sell pressure after 180 days → price drop risk

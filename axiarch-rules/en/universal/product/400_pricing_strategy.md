## Part I. Philosophy of Pricing

### 1.1. Three Pricing Mistakes

- **Rule 13.001**: The following pricing approaches are defined as inadequate

| Wrong Approach | Problem |
|:--------------|:--------|
| **Cost-Plus Pricing** | Ignores customer value. Stamps the product as low-value |
| **Competitor-Follow Pricing** | Denies own differentiation. Enters a price war spiral |
| **Gut-Feel Pricing** | Conviction without data. Cannot judge opportunity loss vs. excessive churn |

### 1.2. Value-Based Pricing

- **Rule 13.002**: The correct pricing principle is to **capture a portion of the value the customer receives**

```
Correct starting point for pricing:
1. Quantify the value customers achieve with our product
   Example: 10 hours/month saved × $50/hour = $500/month value
2. Price at 10-30% of that value
   Example: $500 × 20% = $100/month
3. Adjust positioning relative to competitors
```

- **Rule 13.002a**: Adapting to COGS Structure Changes in AI-Native SaaS
  - Recognize that AI-Native SaaS gross margins structurally decline to **20-60%** compared to traditional SaaS margins of 70-90%
  - Maintain the "10-30% of value" principle while considering raising the Price Floor to Cost-to-Serve × 1.5 (targeting 50% margin)
  - Anticipate the rapid decline in AI inference costs (Moore's Law of AI) and factor in **predicted costs 12 months ahead**, not just current cost structures

### 1.3. Willingness to Pay (WTP) Measurement Mandate

- **Rule 13.003**: Before setting a price, **WTP** must be quantitatively measured
- **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM)** is the standard method

```
PSM 4 Questions:
1. "At what price would it be too expensive to consider?" (Too Expensive)
2. "At what price would you consider it expensive but still consider?" (Expensive)
3. "At what price would you consider it a bargain?" (Cheap)
4. "At what price would you question its quality?" (Too Cheap)

Optimal price range = intersection of Q2 and Q3
```

### 1.4. Price-Value Equation

- **Rule 13.004**: All pricing decisions are evaluated against the following equation

```
Perceived Value ≥ Price > Cost-to-Serve

- Perceived Value falls below Price → Customer churn
- Price falls below Cost-to-Serve → Business unsustainable
- The zone satisfying both conditions = "Sustainable Price Band"

AI-Era Extension:
- Cost-to-Serve is NOT fixed; treat it as a variable including inference cost volatility risk
- Volatility Buffer: Calculate Cost-to-Serve × 1.2 as the effective minimum cost
- Price Band = [Cost-to-Serve × 1.3, Perceived Value × 0.3]
```

- **Rule 13.005**: Perceived Value = Functional Value (time/cost savings) + Emotional Value (peace of mind/status) + Social Value (brand/community)

### 1.5. Pricing as Product

- **Rule 13.006**: Treat pricing design as a formal component of the product roadmap
  - Price changes require the same planning, testing, and rollout process as feature releases
  - Clearly define pricing ownership (PM / Growth / Finance tri-party consensus)

### 1.6. Temporal Pricing Philosophy

- **Rule 13.007**: Design pricing strategy along the **time axis**. Each phase of the product lifecycle requires a distinct pricing approach.

```
Product Lifecycle × Pricing Strategy Matrix:

Phase 1 — Early Adopter (Exploration)
  - Objective: Feedback acquisition & PMF validation
  - Pricing: Low price or free (prioritize validating value hypotheses)
  - Typical Price Point: Bottom 25% of WTP distribution
  - Warning Signal: Revenue maximization at this stage causes early churn

Phase 2 — Growth
  - Objective: CAC recovery & NRR maximization
  - Pricing: WTP median. Freemium + PLG expansion
  - Justification for increases: Value uplift from feature additions and user growth
  - KPI: NRR ≥ 110%, CVR ≥ 5%

Phase 3 — Scale
  - Objective: Margin maximization & market dominance
  - Pricing: Value-Based × Segment differentiation
  - Enterprise Transition: Begin Seat-to-Outcome migration (→ §13.2)
  - KPI: ARR Growth ≥ 50% y/y

Phase 4 — Maturity
  - Objective: LTV maximization & expansion revenue
  - Pricing: Expansion Revenue focus (NBO, AI Add-on)
  - Renewal Pricing: MSRP revision linked to cost-to-serve evolution
  - KPI: NRR ≥ 120%, GRR ≥ 90%
```

- **Rule 13.007a**: Early Adopter Price Lock Design
  - Grandfather pricing for early adopters is capped at a maximum of **24 months**, after which staged migration is mandatory
  - "Permanent Early Adopter pricing" is prohibited (→ §6.3 Grandfather Clause)
  - Early Adopter price range: **50–70%** of standard price is the recommended range

- **Rule 13.007b**: Product-Price Fit Validation Protocol
  - Use price as a "filter" to measure PMF achievement
  - Indicator: If ≥ **30%** of users cancel even when free → Product problem, not a pricing problem
  - If ≥ **80%** of paid users continue → Price-value fit is achieved

### 1.7. Race-to-Zero Defense Protocol

- **Rule 13.008**: Mandatory defense strategy against the AI-driven price deflation spiral ("Race to Zero") affecting commoditizing AI feature categories

```
Race-to-Zero Risk Assessment:

High-Risk Signals (reassess pricing immediately if 2+ apply):
  □ Core AI feature replicated by ≥ 3 competitors at 50%+ lower price
  □ Underlying foundation model costs declined ≥ 40% year-on-year
  □ Customer WTP survey shows ≥ 20% drop vs. prior measurement
  □ Average contract value declining ≥ 5% per quarter

Defense Strategies (apply in order):
1. Value Layer Elevation
   - Shift billing from commoditized AI outputs to differentiated workflows
   - Example: "text generation" (commodity) → "compliance-checked contract drafting" (differentiated)
   - Target: Identify 1 new differentiated layer per quarter

2. Data Moat Monetization
   - Proprietary training data, domain-specific fine-tuning, and customer data
     accumulated via usage constitute a pricing moat competitors cannot clone
   - Quantify data moat advantage: "Our model trained on X domain interactions
     achieves Y% better accuracy than generic models"

3. Ecosystem Lock-in Pricing
   - Bundle pricing with integrations, workflows, and audit trails that become
     embedded in customer operations (switching cost > price difference)
   - Target: Switching Cost Index ≥ 6 months of subscription value

4. Speed-to-Outcome Premium
   - As AI capability commoditizes, time-to-outcome and reliability become
     the differentiator — price on SLA guarantees (uptime, response time, accuracy)
   - Example: Standard tier (99% uptime) vs. Premium tier (99.9% uptime + 50ms SLA)
```

- **Rule 13.008a**: Commodity Feature Deprecation Protocol
  - When an AI feature becomes fully commoditized (≥ 3 competitors offer identical capability for free):
    1. Move the feature to a lower tier or free plan within **90 days**
    2. Simultaneously launch a differentiated successor feature at a premium price point
    3. Never price-compete on commoditized capabilities — reframe or reposition
  - Deprecation cadence review: **Quarterly** (Pricing Committee standing agenda)

- **Rule 13.008b**: Price Floor Defense under Deflationary Pressure
  - Even under aggressive competitive price pressure, the absolute Price Floor (§3.6 Cost-to-Serve × 1.3) **cannot be violated**
  - If maintaining Price Floor results in losing a customer segment: Accept the loss and reallocate CAC budget to defensible segments
  - **Prohibited**: Offering AI features below Cost-to-Serve to "buy" market share (destroys margin permanently with no recovery path)

---

## Part II. Pricing Model Design

### 2.1. SaaS Pricing Model Types

- **Rule 13.010**: Select the pricing model that fits product characteristics

| Model | Description | Best For |
|:------|:-----------|:---------|
| **Flat Rate** | Single monthly fee | Simple products, early PMF validation |
| **Per Seat** | Charge per user | Collaboration/communication tools |
| **Usage-based** | Charge per consumption | APIs, cloud, AI services |
| **Tiered** | Graduated by features/capacity | Most SaaS |
| **Hybrid** | Base fee + usage | Enterprise SaaS |
| **Freemium** | Free base + paid Premium | Consumer, PLG |
| **Outcome-based** | Charge per result delivered | AI Agents, consulting |
| **Credits/Token** | Prepaid credit consumption | AI features, multi-function platforms |
| **Agent License** | Per-agent license fee | Autonomous AI agents, RPA |

### 2.2. Usage-Based Pricing (UBP) Design Protocol

- **Rule 13.011**: When adopting UBP, select a single Value Metric using the following criteria

```
Value Metric Selection Criteria:
□ Does it increase proportionally as customers receive value?
□ Can customers understand and predict it?
□ Can we control and measure it?
□ Is it easy to compare with competitors?

Good: Twilio=SMS count, Snowflake=query volume, Stripe=payment volume
Bad: CPU seconds (technical metric customers don't understand)
```

- **Rule 13.012**: UBP must always provide **Spend Cap / Budget Alert** to customers to eradicate "Bill Shock"

- **Rule 13.012a**: Committed Use Discount (CUD) Design Principles
  - Offer unit price discounts in exchange for committing to a minimum monthly usage volume
  - CUD discount rate: Design within **10-30%** range based on commitment level
  - Explicitly state rollover eligibility at contract time (→ 300 §8 revenue recognition alignment)
  - Revenue predictability target: CUD ratio should exceed 40% of total revenue

### 2.3. Freemium Design Protocol

- **Rule 13.013**: Freemium gate design follows `300_revenue_monetization` §2 Gate Strategy
- **Rule 13.014**: Three principles of free plan design

```
1. Create a state where value is "experienced" but "insufficient"
2. Limitations make users feel "I want more"
3. Team/organization use requires upgrade

Target: Free→Paid conversion rate (CVR) ≥ 5%
```

### 2.4. Outcome-Based Pricing

- **Rule 13.015**: When adopting outcome-based pricing, pre-define the following

| Element | Definition | Example |
|:--------|:----------|:--------|
| **Success Metric** | Quantitative outcome indicator | Resolved tickets, leads generated |
| **Attribution Rule** | Logic for attributing outcomes | AI-only resolution vs. human escalation |
| **Verification** | Proof of outcome achievement | Immutable logs, customer sign-off |
| **Dispute Protocol** | Dispute resolution for unmet outcomes | SLA guarantee, refund conditions |

- **Rule 13.016**: Do not adopt Outcome-Based pricing when outcome definitions are ambiguous. Start with Usage-Based and migrate after data accumulation

### 2.5. Credits/Token Economy Pricing

- **Rule 13.017**: Design principles for credit-based models

```
1. Universal Credit Unit: Abstract different features into a single credit
2. Exchange Rate: Manage feature-cost exchange rates in DB (no code deploy)
3. Balance Visibility: Real-time balance and consumption history display
4. Rollover Policy: Explicitly state rollover rules at contract time (→ 300 §8 rev rec)
5. Top-up Incentive: Volume discount design for bulk purchases
```

- **Rule 13.017a**: Credit-to-Value Alignment Protocol
  - Map credit consumption units to the **smallest unit of customer-perceived value** (not technical token consumption)
  - Example: 1 credit = 1 document generation, 1 analysis run (× not "1,000 tokens")
  - Design the credit exchange rate as a **buffer layer absorbing backend AI inference cost fluctuations**
  - Exchange rate changes require **30-day advance notice** (→ align with §6.2 notification protocol)
  - Send replenishment notification when credit balance falls below **20%** (→ coordinate with Bill Shock prevention)

### 2.6. Hybrid Pricing Architecture

- **Rule 13.018**: Design the fixed:variable ratio at **70:30 to 60:40**
- **Rule 13.019**: If the variable portion exceeds 50% of revenue, consider raising the base fee or introducing minimum commits
- Technical implementation: refer to `300_revenue_monetization` §2 Hybrid Billing Protocol

### 2.7. AI-Era Model Selection Matrix

- **Rule 13.020**: Model selection criteria by product characteristics

| Decision Axis | Flat/Seat | Usage-Based | Outcome-Based | Hybrid |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|:-------------|:-------|
| **Value scales with usage** | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Revenue predictability** | ✓✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| **Customer cost predictability** | ✓✓ | △ | △ | ✓ |
| **AI cost pass-through** | ✗ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✓✓ |
| **PLG compatibility** | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✗ | ✓ |

### 2.8. Subscription Lifecycle Pricing

- **Rule 13.021**: Trial Design Protocol

```
Trial Method Selection Matrix:

| Method | Use Case | CVR Target |
|:-------|:---------|:----------|
| Free Trial (7 days) | Tools with immediate clear value | ≥30% |
| Free Trial (14 days) | Tools with learning curves | ≥25% |
| Free Trial (30 days) | Tools requiring org-wide deployment | ≥15% |
| Freemium | PLG model, large-scale user acquisition | ≥5% |
| Reverse Trial | Full feature unlock→restriction for value experience | ≥20% |

Reverse Trial Design:
- Provide all features free (time-limited)
- Auto-downgrade to free plan after period ends
- Visualize "features you will lose" to leverage loss aversion bias
```

- **Rule 13.022**: Auto-Renewal Compliance

| Jurisdiction | Law | Notification Obligation |
|:------------|:----|:-----------------------|
| **US/CA** | CA CARL 2025 | Clear pre-renewal notice + cancellation as easy as signup |
| **US** | ROSCA + State Laws | Clear disclosure + affirmative consent |
| **EU** | Consumer Rights Directive | Pre-renewal notice + easy cancellation |
| **JP** | Act on Specified Commercial Transactions | Clear contract terms display + cooling-off |

- **Rule 13.023**: Pause/Hibernate Plan Design
  - Offer a "pause" plan as an alternative to cancellation
  - Pause period: Maximum **3 months** (auto-cancel beyond)
  - Guarantee data retention during pause, minimize return friction
  - Return rate target from pause: **≥50%**

### 2.9. Contextual Pricing

- **Rule 13.024**: Pricing presentation design principles for AI agents, chat, and voice interfaces

```
Contextual Pricing — 3 Design Principles:
1. Channel Awareness
   - Same pricing for Web UI and AI agent channels, but optimize the presentation method
   - Within AI chat: complete inline purchases rather than redirecting to a pricing page

2. Intent-Based Pricing Surface
   - Infer upgrade intent from user behavior context (high utilization,
     repeated attempts at specific features) and present pricing at optimal timing
   - "Sudden price display" creates friction. Always: value first → price second

3. Conversational Upsell Protocol
   - In-chat upgrade recommendations must occur in the context of the user's goal resolution
   - "Pay-to-Resolve" pattern: Confirm user's goal → Present how paid feature solves it
   - Prohibited: Abrupt price presentation ignoring conversation flow (Dark Pattern equivalent)
```

- **Rule 13.024a**: Voice Commerce Pricing Protocol
  - Limit pricing presentations in voice interfaces (AI voice assistants, etc.) to **3 price points maximum**
  - Do not present complex tier comparisons by voice; redirect to visual channels (email/app)
  - Voice purchase confirmation requires **2-step verification** (intent confirmation → amount confirmation)

### 2.10. Platform / Marketplace Pricing Strategy

- **Rule 13.025**: Pricing design principles for platform-type (two-sided market / multi-sided) businesses

```
Two-Sided Market Pricing Framework:
1. Identify the Subsidized Side
   - Set the side that "generates" network value to free or low price
   - Example: Job board → Job seekers (free) vs. Employers (paid)
   - Example: Marketplace → Sellers (low take rate) vs. Buyers (paid premium features)

2. Design the Revenue Side
   - Monetize the side that "receives" network value
   - Take Rate benchmark: 3-15% of GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)
   - Fee structures: Flat Rate / Tiered by GMV / Category-based

3. Take Rate Optimization
   - Early stage: Low take rate to ensure Liquidity
   - Growth stage: Gradually raise after network effects are established
   - Ceiling: Level at which sellers won't leave the platform (within 120% of competitor take rate)
```

- **Rule 13.025a**: Frictionless Marketplace Monetization Design
  - Do not restrict seller pricing (forcing minimum prices is an anti-pattern)
  - **Dynamic Take Rate**: Progressively reduce fees based on seller revenue scale and tenure
  - **Settlement Speed Premium**: Fast settlements (same-day payouts) designed as additional fee (Premium Take Rate)
  - Platform fee changes require **90-day advance notice** (sellers build business plans around these)

- **Rule 13.025b**: SaaS × Marketplace Hybrid Pricing Design
  - SaaS subscription (fixed monthly) + transaction fee hybrid is the standard
  - Recommended ratio: SaaS fixed revenue 40-60% / Transaction revenue 40-60%
  - If transaction revenue exceeds 60%, consider raising the fixed SaaS component (revenue stability)

### 2.11. Consumption-Based Commitment (CBC) Model

- **Rule 13.026**: CBC model (consumption commit) design principles
  - Apply AWS Savings Plans / Google CUD-style "flexible commitment" to SaaS
  - Grant discounts based on **commitment to consumption amount**, not to specific SKUs

```
CBC Design Framework:
1. Commit Unit: Monthly consumption amount (e.g., $500/month commit)
2. Discount Tier:
   | Commit Amount | Discount Rate |
   |:-------------|:--------------|
   | $500-$999    | 10%           |
   | $1,000-$4,999 | 15%          |
   | $5,000+      | 20%           |
3. Flexibility Rule: Applicable to any feature/SKU within the commit
4. Overage: Amounts exceeding the commit continue at on-demand (no discount)
5. Term: 1-year / 3-year commit (3-year receives an additional 5% discount)
```

- **Rule 13.026a**: CBC + Usage-Based combination guardrails
  - Rollover of unconsumed commit: Allow rollover within **3 months** (→ align with 300 §8 revenue recognition)
  - Customers with commit attainment below **80%** require a CSM review before the next commit renewal
  - Provide customers with a real-time **commit consumption dashboard** to visualize their spend-to-commit ratio

### 2.12. Embedded Finance Pricing

- **Rule 13.027**: Design principles for embedding payments, lending, insurance, and BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) into the product

```
4 Monetization Types of Embedded Finance:

1. Payment Processing
   - Fee rate: 0.5-1.5% of GMV (for direct provision)
   - Conduct annual cost comparison: in-house vs. third-party PSP
   - Use payment data as a signal for Usage-Based pricing calculations

2. Embedded Lending
   - Revenue-Based Financing: Set repayment at 1-5% of monthly revenue
   - Pricing design: Bundling lending fees + subscription = higher Stickiness
   - Risk management: Lending limit = average MRR (last 6 months) × 3 as ceiling

3. Embedded Insurance
   - Free bundling with premium plans (increases perceived value)
   - May add 10-20% of standalone insurance premium to plan price

4. BNPL Integration
   - Offering BNPL for high-ticket plans targets CVR improvement ≥ 15%
   - Determine upfront whether BNPL fees (2-6%) are provider-absorbed or passed through
   - Recommended target: Annual plans of $500+
```

- **Rule 13.027a**: Price Transparency Obligation for Embedded Finance
  - All fees, interest rates, and conditions of embedded financial services must be **fully disclosed before purchase**
  - Legal disclosures such as "APR (Annual Percentage Rate)" follow jurisdiction-specific rules (see §15)
  - Financial regulatory licenses must be obtained before offering services (unlicensed provision is absolutely prohibited)

- **Rule 13.027b**: Competitive Advantage Design for Embedded Finance × Pricing
  - **Data Moat**: As payment/usage data accumulates, credit scoring precision improves → enabling Value-Based Pricing that competitors cannot replicate
  - **Switching Cost**: Churn rate of customers with outstanding embedded loans targets **60-70% lower** than general customers
  - Add **Blended ARR** (including Embedded Finance revenue) as a KPI (→ align with §12 KPIs)

### 2.13. B2B2C / White-Label Pricing Governance

- **Rule 13.028**: Pricing design principles for scenarios where the company's API or platform is provided as a white-label for partner companies to resell to end users

```
B2B2C Pricing Architecture — 3-Layer Design:

Layer 1 — Platform Cost
  - Wholesale pricing from the company to partners
  - Principle: Cost-to-Serve × 1.3 minimum (→ align with §3.6 Price Floor)
  - Partner pricing based on API usage volume or number of end users

Layer 2 — Partner Margin Zone
  - Design a price band within which partners can independently mark up
  - Recommended range: Platform Cost × 1.2–3.0 (varies by industry/added value)
  - Define Min/Max end-user price range in contract terms (prevent price erosion/excessive extraction)

Layer 3 — End-User Experience
  - End users perceive price under the partner brand, not the company brand
  - Clearly distinguish in contracts between Full White-Label (company identity fully hidden)
    and Semi White-Label (Powered-By disclosure required)
```

- **Rule 13.028a**: Mandatory White-Label Price Floor Enforcement
  - Prohibit partner end-user pricing from **falling below the lowest public plan price**
  - Include automatic contract termination clause for violations in Partner Agreements
  - Conduct quarterly audits of end-user pricing by partner

- **Rule 13.028b**: B2B2C Revenue Share Model Design Principles

| Revenue Model | Description | Best Fit |
|:-------------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Revenue Share** | Collect a percentage of end-user revenue | Partner independently acquires customers |
| **Platform Fee + Usage** | Monthly base fee + end-user count/usage billing | Partners with large end-user bases |
| **Wholesale Flat** | Fixed monthly wholesale regardless of end-user count | Small partners, pre-PMF |
| **Tiered by EUS** | Tiered wholesale based on End User Scale (EUS) | Scaling partners |

- **Rule 13.028c**: White-Label Pricing Transparency Obligations
  - Define a disclosure policy in partner contracts for when end users ask "Who provides the underlying technology?"
  - For white-label in financial, medical, or insurance sectors, always confirm disclosure obligations with legal counsel
  - Partner contract change notice obligation (including pricing changes): **60 days** (→ align with §6.2 notification protocol)

### 2.14. Composable Pricing-as-a-Service (CPaaS) Architecture

- **Rule 13.029**: Design pricing logic as a first-class, API-accessible service — fully decoupled from application code and UI layers

```
CPaaS Architecture — 4-Layer Design:

Layer 1 — Pricing Engine Core
  - Single source of truth for all pricing rules, tiers, and entitlements
  - Technology: Headless pricing DB (e.g., Stripe Products/Prices, custom Pricing Service)
  - NO price values hardcoded in application code (→ align with §14.3 SSOT)

Layer 2 — Pricing API
  - RESTful or GraphQL API exposing:
    GET /pricing/plans          → list all active plans
    GET /pricing/quote          → personalized quote for a customer segment
    POST /pricing/validate      → validate a custom configuration
    GET /pricing/entitlements   → feature gate state for a customer
  - Authentication: API key + JWT with customer context
  - Rate limiting: 1,000 req/min per partner (→ align with §13.4 A2A guardrails)

Layer 3 — Pricing SDK / Widgets
  - Embeddable UI components (React, Web Components) that render
    real-time pricing from the Pricing API — no frontend price duplication
  - Supports: Pricing Page, In-app Upgrade Prompts, Checkout flows

Layer 4 — Pricing Webhook & Event Bus
  - Emit events on price changes: price.updated, plan.deprecated, entitlement.changed
  - Partners and internal systems subscribe to pricing events for cache invalidation
  - Event retention: 90 days minimum
```

- **Rule 13.029a**: Composable Pricing Governance Requirements
  - All price changes must flow through the Pricing API — direct DB mutations outside the API are **absolutely prohibited**
  - API versioning: Use `v1`, `v2` URL prefixes; maintain backward compatibility for **12 months** after version deprecation notice
  - Pricing API availability SLA: **99.9%** (pricing downtime = checkout revenue loss)
  - Implement **read-through caching** at the API gateway layer (TTL: 60 seconds) to eliminate pricing page latency

- **Rule 13.029b**: Partner & Agent Integration via CPaaS
  - Expose a partner-scoped Pricing API token allowing white-label partners to query
    applicable pricing for their end-user segment (→ align with §2.13 B2B2C)
  - AI agents can query real-time pricing for autonomous purchase decisions
    (→ align with §13.4 A2A Commerce, subject to §13.4 Autonomous Commerce Guardrails)
  - **Machine-readable pricing catalog** (JSON-LD Schema.org `Offer`) is generated
    automatically from the Pricing API response (→ align with §11.5)

- **Rule 13.029c**: CPaaS Observability Requirements
  - Instrument the Pricing API with: latency p50/p95/p99, error rate, cache hit rate
  - Alert thresholds: error rate > 0.1%, p95 latency > 200ms
  - Monthly Pricing API usage report to Pricing Committee (who calls it, how often, which plans)

## Part III. Pricing Methodology

### 3.1. Five-Step Pricing Process

- **Rule 13.030**: New product/plan pricing follows these 5 steps

```
Step 1: Quantify Value Proposition
→ Customer interviews + ROI calculation for economic value

Step 2: Measure WTP (Willingness to Pay)
→ Van Westendorp PSM / Conjoint Analysis / Direct Survey

Step 3: Analyze WTP by Segment
→ Separate by ICP, company size to understand price bands

Step 4: Benchmark Against Competitors
→ Tier / Feature comparison for positioning

Step 5: A/B Test the Pricing Page (see §7)
→ Validate with actual conversion data
```

### 3.2. Conjoint Analysis

- **Rule 13.031**: For large-scale services (ARR ≥ $1M), conduct Conjoint Analysis to understand attribute-level WTP
  - Minimum 100 responses required

### 3.3. Benchmark Pricing Guidelines

- **Rule 13.032**: Competitor pricing is used as an **upper bound reference**. Pricing below competitors is prohibited by default
  - Equivalent features: Competitor price × 90-110%
  - Clear superiority: Competitor price × 120-200%
  - New category: Set via Value-Based Pricing

### 3.4. Gabor-Granger Method

- **Rule 13.033**: May be adopted to quantitatively measure purchase intent at specific price points
  - Present multiple price levels sequentially, calculate purchase probability at each
  - Combine with PSM to improve optimal price band accuracy

### 3.5. Economic Value to Customer (EVC) Analysis

- **Rule 13.034**: Conduct EVC analysis for B2B pricing

```
EVC = Reference Value + Differentiation Value

Reference Value: Cost of the customer's current alternative
Differentiation Value: Differential value of our product (positive or negative)
  - Positive: Cost reduction, time savings, quality improvement
  - Negative: Learning cost, migration cost, risk

Price ≤ EVC (design to leave ROI for the customer)
```

### 3.6. Cost-to-Serve Analysis (AI Era)

- **Rule 13.035**: For products with AI features, calculate feature-level Cost-to-Serve monthly

| Cost Layer | Content | Example |
|:----------|:--------|:--------|
| **L1: Inference** | Model API calls | Token unit price × consumption |
| **L2: Infrastructure** | GPU/Vector DB/Embeddings | Fixed + variable |
| **L3: Orchestration** | Agent execution platform | Tool call count |
| **L4: Data Pipeline** | RAG vector DB updates, embedding regeneration | Document count × update frequency |

- **Rule 13.036**: Price Floor = Cost-to-Serve × 1.3 (minimum 30% margin)

### 3.7. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Pricing Framework

- **Rule 13.037**: Apply the JTBD framework as the foundational philosophy for pricing
  - Identify the "job" customers hire your product to accomplish, and anchor pricing to the economic value of completing that job

```
JTBD × Pricing Application Process:
Step 1: Identify the Job
  - Functional Job: "I want to automatically generate reports"
  - Emotional Job: "I want to be recognized by my manager"
  - Social Job: "I want to be seen as the team's progressive lead"

Step 2: Quantify the economic value of job completion
  - Functional job value = Time saved × hourly rate
  - Emotional/social jobs: Measure WTP via qualitative interviews

Step 3: Map price bands by job
  - Segments with different jobs get different price tiers
  - Same features can carry different prices if jobs differ (e.g., personal job vs. enterprise job)

Step 4: Align Value Metric to the job
  - Design "Job Completion Rate" as the core Value Metric
```

- **Rule 13.037a**: JTBD Pricing Quantitative Validation Protocol
  - After JTBD analysis, conduct **Conjoint Analysis** per job-based segment to numerically quantify job-specific WTP
  - Job hypothesis validation frequency: **Quarterly** (customer jobs shift with market changes)
  - Report validation results to §14.1 Pricing Committee as input for tier redesign decisions

### 3.8. Network Effects Pricing Framework

- **Rule 13.038**: Design principles for how network effects influence pricing strategy

```
Network Effects × Pricing Interaction:

① Critical Mass Acquisition Phase (users < threshold)
   Strategy: Prioritize acquisition over price
   → Free / Freemium / Referral discounts to ensure Liquidity
   → Invite-Only design to balance perceived scarcity with quality

② Network Establishment Phase (users > threshold)
   Strategy: Begin transferring network value into price
   → Gradual Usage-Based price increases (tied to user growth)
   → Monetize Power Users (heavy users have higher WTP)

③ Dominant Network Effect Phase
   Strategy: Set premium pricing
   → Use competitor switching costs (Data Lock-in) as a pricing moat
   → But mandatory Anti-Trust risk monitoring (→ §15.3)
```

- **Rule 13.038a**: Network Effect Value Quantification Protocol
  - **Metcalfe's Law approximation**: Based on Network Value ∝ n², re-measure WTP at each user tier
  - Measurement frequency: Re-measure WTP each time users **double**
  - Price revision timing: Within **6 months** of measured WTP increase
  - When **Viral Coefficient (K-factor)** exceeds 1.0, prioritize price optimization over acquisition cost

### 3.9. Cohort-Based Pricing Optimization

- **Rule 13.039**: Systematically integrate cohort analysis into pricing optimization

```
Cohort Analysis × Pricing Practice Process:

Step 1: Define Pricing Cohorts
  - Generate pricing cohorts by joining month × initial plan combination
  - Example: 2025-Q1 joiners × Starter plan (N=150)

Step 2: Track Cohort-Level LTV (minimum 12 months)
  - Expansion MRR (upgrades)
  - Contraction MRR (downgrades)
  - Churn timing and usage state at time of churn

Step 3: Compare Cumulative LTV by Price Point
  - Measure LTV divergence between cohorts that joined at different price points
  - Identify price thresholds above which high-price cohorts churn disproportionately

Step 4: Calculate Optimal Price Band
  - Price band that maximizes LTV = Optimal Price Band
  - Formula: Optimal Price = argmax(P) [ P × Cohort_Conversion(P) × Cohort_LTV(P) ]

Step 5: Reflect in Price Revision
  - After validating Optimal Price Band via §7 experiments, deploy via §6.4 Price Increase Playbook
```

- **Rule 13.039a**: Measurement Infrastructure Requirements for Cohort Analysis
  - Attach **price, plan, and channel** to all event logs at join time (design for retroactive analysis)
  - Conduct cohort analysis in the **BI/data warehouse layer** (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.) and integrate with billing SSOT (e.g., Stripe)
  - Use for pricing optimization only after accumulating a minimum of **6 months** of cohort data

- **Rule 13.039b**: LTV Prediction × Pricing
  - Use ML models (survival analysis, propensity scoring, etc.) to predict cohort-level LTV up to 12 months ahead
  - LTV prediction accuracy target: MAPE ≤ 20% (monthly precision)
  - For segments where predicted LTV falls below Price × 3, prioritize **CAC reduction or Price increase**

### 3.10. Agentic ROI Value Metric Quantification

- **Rule 13.039c**: Value quantification protocol for products where AI agents perform role replacement or augmentation of human workers

```
Agentic ROI Calculation Framework:

Step 1: Role Replacement Mapping
  - List all human roles the AI agent replaces or augments
  - Example: Customer Support Agent → replaces CS rep × 0.8 FTE
  - FTE equivalent = (monthly tasks processed × avg task time [h]) / 160 [h/month]

Step 2: Economic Value of Role Replacement
  - Replaced labor cost = FTE equivalent × (role avg annual salary ÷ 12)
  - Example: 0.8 FTE/month × $6,000/month (avg CS rep) = $4,800/month economic value
  - Additional value: 24/7 operation, multilingual support, zero wait time — value impossible with human FTE

Step 3: Business Outcome Attribution
  - Churn prevention: churns prevented by agent × avg LTV
  - Revenue increase: upsells generated by agent × avg contract value
  - Cost reduction: labor cost savings + infrastructure cost savings

Step 4: Value-Based Price Derivation
  - Price = Total economic value × Value Capture Rate (recommended: 10-30%)
  - Example: $4,800/month economic value × 20% = $960/month
  - Verify price ≥ Cost × 3 (→ align with §3.6 Price Floor)

Step 5: Customer ROI Calculator Implementation
  - Provide an "ROI Calculator" where customers input their own numbers to compute ROI
  - Embed results in sales decks and pricing pages
```

- **Rule 13.039d**: Value Metric Selection Principles for Agentic Commerce
  - Billing units for agent products must be one of: "tasks executed", "successful actions", or "FTE hours saved", matching customer value perception
  - **Prohibited**: Using technical metrics such as token count or API call count as customer-facing billing units (→ align with §13.5)
  - The chosen Value Metric **must be independently measurable by the customer** (verifiability principle)

- **Rule 13.039e**: Continuous Agentic ROI Proof-of-Value Protocol
  - Obligation to report the ROI generated by agents to customers quantitatively on a monthly basis
  - Report format: **Delivered Value Summary** (tasks replaced / cost savings / outcome attribution)
  - If ROI drops below **3× Price**, Customer Success is triggered to execute value improvement measures (→ align with §6.7 Revenue Resilience)

---

### 3.12. Customer Health-Indexed Price Sensitivity Protocol

- **Rule 13.039h**: Dynamically classify customer price sensitivity based on real-time Customer Health Score (CHS) to apply optimal pricing interventions

```
Customer Health-Indexed Pricing Framework:

Health Score Dimensions (equally weighted, score 0-100):
  - Engagement Score:    DAU/MAU ratio, feature adoption breadth
  - Outcome Score:       Achieved ROI vs. promised ROI (§3.10 Agentic ROI)
  - Relationship Score:  NPS, support ticket sentiment, CSM interaction quality
  - Growth Signal:       Seat/usage trend (past 90 days), upgrade intent flags

Segmentation by CHS:
  🟢 Healthy (CHS ≥ 70): Low price sensitivity → Expansion-ready
     → Trigger NBO (§4.8) and upsell flows proactively
     → Annual renewal: offer multi-year lock-in at 0-5% premium

  🟡 At-Risk (CHS 40-69): Moderate price sensitivity → Value reinforcement needed
     → Increase Delivered Value Summary frequency to monthly
     → Do NOT reduce price — reinforce ROI first (→ §6.5 Value Realization Loop)
     → If CHS < 50 at 60-day mark: CSM intervention + temporary feature unlock

  🔴 Churning (CHS < 40): High price sensitivity → Surgical intervention only
     → Offer Pause Plan (§2.8) or Flex Pricing (§6.7) before discount
     → Discount as last resort: max 20% for 3 months with recovery KPI gate
     → If CHS does not recover to ≥ 50 within 90 days: accept churn gracefully
```

- **Rule 13.039i**: CHS-Triggered Pricing Automation Rules
  - Automate CHS calculation: **daily** refresh from billing, usage, and support data
  - CHS drop of **≥15 points in 30 days** auto-triggers Pricing Committee alert
  - Never automatically apply a discount based on CHS without **human approval** (Pricing Committee or CSM manager)
  - Log all CHS-triggered pricing interventions in the Pricing Audit Trail (→ §14.4)

- **Rule 13.039j**: CHS × Cohort Pricing Optimization Integration
  - Cross-reference CHS at join-time with 12-month LTV to identify "High-CHS cohorts" that are also high-LTV
  - These segments are candidates for **price increase testing** (§7 Experimentation) with minimal churn risk
  - Report CHS-LTV correlation matrix to Pricing Committee **quarterly** as input for tier redesign

---

### 3.11. AI-Native Competitive Intelligence Protocol

- **Rule 13.039f**: Bottom-Up Cost Intelligence — reverse-engineering competitor AI function costs

```
Competitor AI Price Intelligence Collection Framework:

Step 1: Cost Estimation from Public Information
  - Collect competitor public API docs and Pricing Pages
  - Estimate COGS from published API rates (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini, etc.)
  - Formula: Competitor COGS ≈ (API unit price × estimated consumption) / (1 - estimated gross margin)

Step 2: Competitor Pricing Model Classification
  - Identify billing units (Seat / Usage / Outcome)
  - Detailed mapping of bundle structure and tier pricing
  - Comparison of free-tier design (Freemium Limit, Trial period)

Step 3: Gap Analysis and Self-Positioning
  - Feature-per-Dollar comparison: own vs. competitor feature/price ratio
  - AI Capability-per-Dollar: AI feature quality × cost efficiency
  - Position classification: Premium / Parity / Value

Step 4: Update & Monitoring System
  - Auto-detect: competitor pricing page change detection (HTML diffing)
  - Alert: analysis report within 72 hours of change detection
  - Monthly: submit competitive price summary to Pricing Committee
```

- **Rule 13.039g**: Ethical Guidelines for Competitive Intelligence Collection
  - Scraping that violates competitor ToS is **absolutely prohibited**
  - Collection from public pricing pages, press releases, and SEC Filings is permitted
  - Unauthorized acquisition of internal pricing via stealth accounts is prohibited (→ §15.3 Anti-Cartel)
  - Legal approval required before disclosing competitor pricing to third parties

---

## Part IV. Packaging & Tier Design

### 4.1. Tier Design Principles

- **Rule 13.040**: Price tiers default to **3 options** (Good-Better-Best)
- **Rule 13.041**: Design so the majority of customers select the **middle tier** (Goldilocks Principle)

```
Recommended: Starter / Pro / Enterprise (3 tiers)
Or: Free / Growth / Business / Enterprise (4 tiers presented as 3 choices)
```

### 4.2. Decoy Pricing

- **Rule 13.042**: A tier that functions as a "decoy" may be designed to make the middle tier appear most rational

### 4.3. Anchor Pricing

- **Rule 13.043**: Display **higher prices first/left** on the pricing page to lower perceived cost of the middle tier
- **Rule 13.044**: For annual billing, display the monthly equivalent to emphasize "per month" savings

### 4.4. Feature Packaging Rules

- **Rule 13.045**: Feature allocation principles per tier

| Tier | Features to Include |
|:-----|:-------------------|
| **Starter** | Minimum for core value experience, individual/small-scale |
| **Pro** | Team collaboration, permissions, API, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | SSO/SAML, custom SLA, dedicated CSM, audit logs |

### 4.5. Good-Better-Best (GBB) Framework

- **Rule 13.046**: GBB framework design principles

```
Good (Starter):
- Price: Set at lower 25th percentile of WTP
- Purpose: Lower entry barriers, initiate product experience
- Constraint: Core features only, quantity-limited

Better (Pro / Recommended Tier):
- Price: Set at WTP median (should be most selected)
- Purpose: The "optimal choice" for the majority
- Design: Deliver 3x+ perceived value vs. Good

Best (Enterprise):
- Price: Upper 10th percentile of WTP or "Contact Us"
- Purpose: Maximum monetization of high-touch customers
- Design: Differentiated exclusive value vs. Better
```

### 4.6. Add-on & Upsell Architecture

- **Rule 13.047**: Design **horizontal expansion (Add-ons)** alongside tier upgrades
  - Add-ons provide standalone value and can be added to any tier
  - Examples: AI feature pack, additional storage, priority support
- **Rule 13.048**: Upsell triggers fire at **80% of limit reached**, designing natural upgrade paths

- **Rule 13.048a**: AI Add-on Independent P&L Management Mandate
  - When offering AI features as Add-ons, manage an **independent P&L (Profit & Loss statement)**
  - Maintain AI Add-on standalone gross margin **≥30%** (→ align with 300 Circuit Breaker)
  - Indiscriminate bundling of AI features into base plans is an anti-pattern (→ §16.2 #31)

### 4.7. Bundle Design Protocol

- **Rule 13.049**: Bundle (multi-feature/service package) design principles
  - Bundle price = **70-85%** of individual purchase total
  - Show each item's value explicitly to quantify savings
  - When bundling 3+ items, anchor around the most popular item

### 4.8. Next Best Offer (NBO) Intelligent Bundling

- **Rule 13.049a**: LLM/ML-powered real-time personalized bundle recommendation design

```
NBO Engine Architecture:

Input Signals:
  - Customer's current plan, usage patterns, and utilization frequency
  - Past Add-on purchase history
  - Purchase patterns of customers in the same segment (collaborative filtering)
  - Last 30 days of feature trial behavior (Feature Affinity Score)

Recommendation Logic:
  - Predict the Add-on / upgrade the customer is most likely to value next
  - Rank by LTV maximization as the objective function
  - Prioritize discount bundles for high "price sensitivity score" customers
  - Prioritize feature-enhancement bundles for high "value orientation score" customers

Output:
  - Deliver NBO via in-app / email / CSM dashboard
  - Generate A/B test variants (→ align with §7 Experimentation)
```

- **Rule 13.049b**: Ethical Constraints and Transparency for NBO
  - **Prohibited**: Recommending bundles that serve only revenue maximization but are unnecessary for the customer
  - Disclose recommendation rationale as "Based on your usage patterns" to ensure transparency
  - NBO delivery frequency limit per customer: **2 times per month** (excessive recommendations increase churn)
  - Measure NBO recommendation accuracy (Accept Rate) monthly; target **≥ 20%**
  - If Accept Rate falls below 10%, retrain the model or revisit input signals

- **Rule 13.049c**: Generative AI Content Licensing Price Integration
  - For generated content (images, video, music, code) provided for commercial use, integrate **copyright and licensing value** into pricing design

  | License Tier | Pricing Structure | Notes |
  |:------------|:----------------|:------|
  | **Personal Use** | Freemium / included in low-cost plans | Non-commercial use only |
  | **Commercial License** | Add-on / Pro tier and above only | Commercial use, third-party distribution |
  | **Extended License** | Enterprise / individual negotiation | Broadcast rights, exclusive use |
  | **API Output License** | Usage-based + licensing fee | When generated output is embedded in products |

  - To address training data copyright concerns (EU AI Act Article 53), include a clause reserving the right to modify license terms in the Terms of Service

---

## Part V. Pricing Psychology & Behavioral Economics

### 5.1. Anchoring Effect

- **Rule 13.050**: The first price displayed on the pricing page acts as an "anchor" influencing overall price perception
  - Place higher-priced tiers on the left/top
  - Display discount rates from "regular price" to set anchors
  - Enterprise "Contact Us" functions as a high-price anchor

### 5.2. Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

- **Rule 13.051**: Decoy tier design rules
  - Position the decoy as a "clearly inferior choice" compared to the target tier
  - Small price difference, large feature difference between decoy and target
  - A/B test decoy effectiveness quantitatively (see §7)

### 5.3. Loss Aversion & FOMO

- **Rule 13.052**: Loss aversion bias application principles
  - "This price available until [date]" (time-limited)
  - "Lock in permanent discount as an early adopter" (Early Adopter Pricing)
  - Downgrade warnings showing features that will become unavailable
- **Rule 13.053**: FOMO may **only** be used when based on facts. False scarcity is prohibited as a Dark Pattern (see §15)

### 5.4. Framing Effect

- **Rule 13.054**: Leverage how price display affects perception

| Framing Technique | Example | Effect |
|:-----------------|:--------|:-------|
| **Daily breakdown** | "Just $1.10/day" | Makes large amounts seem small |
| **Savings emphasis** | "Save 2 months with annual" | Drives annual billing |
| **ROI display** | "$100/mo for $500/mo value" | Visualizes investment return |
| **Comparison frame** | "Less than a coffee per day" | Compares to familiar spending |

### 5.5. Social Proof in Pricing

- **Rule 13.055**: "Most Popular" badge display criteria
  - Only award to the tier actually selected most often (false claims prohibited)
  - Display specific numbers: "Used by X companies", "Chosen by X users"
  - Place customer logos by industry/size on each tier

### 5.6. Price Ending Psychology

- **Rule 13.056**: Price ending strategies

| Strategy | Price Example | Use Case |
|:---------|:------------|:---------|
| **Charm Pricing** | $49 / ¥4,980 | Consumer, price-sensitive markets |
| **Round Pricing** | $50 / ¥5,000 | Premium, quality positioning |
| **Precise Pricing** | $48.73 / ¥4,873 | Post-discount prices (signals calculated result) |

### 5.7. Ethical Guardrails

- **Rule 13.057**: Application limits for pricing psychology techniques
  - **Prohibited**: False scarcity, fictitious "regular prices", price discrimination by personal attributes
  - **Permitted**: Fact-based Social Proof, rational anchoring, legitimate time-limited offers
  - Detailed prohibitions in §15 (Dark Pattern Ban)

### 5.8. Endowment Effect & Sunk Cost

- **Rule 13.058**: Endowment Effect Application Principles
  - Visualize data, settings, and customizations users invested during trial as "what you'll lose"
  - At Reverse Trial end, display "your X items of data created" to strengthen upgrade motivation
  - **Ethical boundary**: Data hostage lock-in is prohibited. Always provide data export after downgrade

- **Rule 13.059**: Sunk Cost Ethical Guardrails
  - **Permitted**: "Leverage your investment" framing for upgrade recommendations
  - **Prohibited**: "Cancel now and your completed data will be lost" threatening expressions

### 5.9. AI Agent Context Anchoring

- **Rule 13.059a**: Anchoring design principles when AI agents or chatbots present pricing

```
AI Agent Anchoring 3 Principles:

1. Human-Replacement Cost Anchor
   - Present the "cost of a human performing the same task" first,
     making your price appear cheaper by comparison
   - Example: "This task normally costs $500/month outsourced. Automate it for $100/month."
   - Prohibited: Using fictitious comparison costs (→ align with §5.7 Ethical Guardrails)

2. Competitor Agent Comparison Anchor
   - Display a comparison table of major competitor AI agent published prices
   - Always use the latest published prices; prevent misleading with stale information
   - Update frequency: Within 72 hours of detecting competitor pricing page changes

3. Per-Task Unit Price Anchor
   - Instead of emphasizing fixed monthly fees, frame as "$X per task" to convey affordability
   - Example: "100 tasks/month = $0.10 per task" (Usage-Based framing)
   - Visualize savings vs. annual commit to anchor annual payment upgrades
```

- **Rule 13.059b**: Prohibited pricing practices in agent recommendation contexts
  - When an AI agent recommends a specific plan and **commission incentives** influence that recommendation,
    disclosure is mandatory (→ align with §15.1 Price Discrimination Prohibition)
  - When claiming "the agent automatically selects the optimal plan", disclose the selection logic

---

### 5.10. Autonomy Effect and Build-Your-Own Plan

- **Rule 13.059c**: WTP uplift protocol through customer-customizable pricing design

```
Applying the Autonomy Effect to Pricing:

Principle: People show greater satisfaction with higher prices when they
have participated in the decision.
→ Even at the same price, "chosen by me" leads to lower churn than "pushed on me"

Build-Your-Own Plan Design Patterns:

1. Modular Pricing
   - Base Fee + selectable modules
   - Example: Core $20 + Analytics $10 + AI Module $30
   - Customers select only needed modules → higher payment acceptance

2. Usage Commitment Slider
   - Select expected monthly usage via slider → price displayed dynamically
   - Immediate display of tiered discounts per commitment (CBC Model integration)
   - Creates the feel of "the optimal price for my usage"

3. Feature Configurator
   - Configure price via feature checkboxes
   - Real-time price preview
   - Confirmed as "Your plan: $X/month"
```

- **Rule 13.059d**: Build-Your-Own Plan Design Constraints
  - Limit options to a maximum of **5** (avoid paradox of choice)
  - Customer-configured prices must be recorded in **Pricing DB (SSOT)** with update history
  - No configuration may fall below the §3.6 Price Floor (Cost-to-Serve × 1.3)
  - Mandatory: Design that creates the feel of "designed it myself" while technically preventing non-viable configurations

- **Rule 13.059e**: Autonomy Effect Measurement Protocol
  - Measure customization effect via A/B test of Build-Your-Own vs. standard plans
  - Metrics: Pricing page CVR / ARPA / 12-month churn rate
  - Expected outcome: **15–25% lower** 12-month churn for custom plan customers at the same ARPA band

---

## Part VI. Price Change Protocol

### 6.1. Price Change Decision Criteria

- **Rule 13.060**: Price changes are executed only when one of the following conditions is met

| Trigger | Condition |
|:--------|:---------|
| **Cost Shift** | Cost-to-Serve changed by ≥ 20% |
| **Value Shift** | Significant feature addition/removal changed Value Proposition |
| **Market Shift** | Competitor price changes, macroeconomic shifts |
| **KPI Anomaly** | Conversion rate, churn, or NRR deviated ≥ 15% from target |

### 6.2. Price Change Notification Protocol

- **Rule 13.061**: Price revisions require the following lead times

| Audience | Minimum Notice | Notification Method |
|:---------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| **Individual Plans** | 30 days | Email + in-app notification |
| **Team Plans** | 60 days | Email + dedicated page + in-app |
| **Enterprise** | 90 days | Direct CSM contact + written notice |

### 6.3. Grandfather Clause (Existing Customer Protection)

- **Rule 13.062**: Price increases for existing customers follow these guidelines
  - Annual increase cap: **10%** as default
  - Grandfather period: Minimum **12 months** at the old price
  - Grandfather expiry: Phased migration (one cycle at midpoint between old and new price)

### 6.4. Price Increase Playbook

- **Rule 13.063**: Step-by-step price increase execution

```
Phase 1 (Preparation, -90 days):
  - Build the "value story" justifying the increase
  - Document quantitative results of new features/improvements

Phase 2 (Announcement, -60 days):
  - Individual notification to existing customers (email + CSM)
  - Publish FAQ and comparison tables

Phase 3 (Transition, -30 to 0 days):
  - Offer annual billing lock-in at current rates
  - Present downgrade options

Phase 4 (Enforcement, D-Day):
  - New customers on new pricing immediately
  - Existing customers under Grandfather Clause

Phase 5 (Monitoring, +30 days):
  - Measure churn rate, Expansion MRR, NPS changes
  - Define rollback criteria for unexpected attrition
```

### 6.5. Downgrade & Cancellation Defense

- **Rule 13.064**: Design a "value reconfirmation" step in cancellation flows
  - Collect cancellation reasons (required, multiple choice)
  - Present alternatives (downgrade, pause, discount offer)
  - **Prohibited**: Hiding cancel buttons, multi-step cancellation flows (Dark Pattern)

- **Rule 13.065**: Value Realization Loop
  - Send monthly usage reports visualizing the value customers receive
  - Auto-generate summaries: "You achieved X with this plan"

### 6.6. Price Migration Strategy (Large-Scale Model Changes)

- **Rule 13.066**: Pricing model changes (e.g., Seat → Usage-Based) follow these stages

```
Stage 1: Apply new model to new customers only (6+ months)
Stage 2: Offer new model as opt-in for existing customers
Stage 3: Default migration for existing customers (after 12-month notice)
Stage 4: Full deprecation of old model (18 months)

KPI: Verify NRR ≥ 100% at each Stage completion
```

### 6.7. Revenue Resilience Protocol

- **Rule 13.067**: Pricing Strategy During Macroeconomic Downturns

```
Principle: Discounting is the last resort. It causes brand damage and recovery difficulty.

Alternative Strategies:
1. Flex Pricing: Temporarily introduce a lower-cost tier (NOT discount existing tiers)
2. Payment Holiday: Offer up to 1 month payment deferral
3. Value Reinforcement: Increase usage report frequency to strengthen value perception
4. Contract Restructuring: Allow temporary switch from annual to monthly billing
```

- **Rule 13.068**: Usage-Based Revenue Volatility Management
  - Monitor Usage-Based revenue coefficient of variation (CV) monthly
  - If CV ≥ 0.3, consider introducing minimum commitments
  - Revenue forecast confidence interval target: ±15%

- **Rule 13.069**: Downturn Pricing Decision Tree

```
Revenue decline > 10%?
├─ Yes → Price-driven?
│     ├─ Yes → Follow §6.1 Price Change criteria
│     └─ No → Usage decline → Implement Value Reinforcement
└─ No → Continue monitoring (re-evaluate in 30 days)
```

---

### 6.8. AI-Triggered Price Review Protocol

- **Rule 13.069a**: Protocol for AI to detect market signals and auto-escalate to Pricing Committee

| Signal | Threshold | Response Action |
|:-------|:---------|:----------------|
| Competitor reduces major plan price **by 15%+** | Detected within 72 hours | Emergency analysis report + committee convened |
| Churn rate rises **+3pp vs prior month** | Monthly measurement | Price-driven churn analysis + 30-day review |
| Monthly usage surges **+50%+** | Monthly measurement | Price appropriateness review + Upsell opportunity check |
| **AI COGS ratio exceeds 40%** | Weekly measurement | §12.7 Circuit Breaker triggered |
| Competitor adds new AI features without price change | Within 48 hours of detection | Feature gap analysis + value proposition redesign |
| PQL-to-Paid CVR **falls below 10%** | Monthly measurement | Price barrier analysis + Trial design review |

Automation Architecture:
  Input: Competitive monitoring bot + Billing SSOT + Usage metering system
  Processing: LLM-driven impact analysis + recommended action generation
  Output: Slack/email notification + auto-added to Pricing Committee agenda

- **Rule 13.069b**: Human Approval Gate for AI Price Review
  - AI-triggered analysis and recommendations are "proposals" only. **Final decisions are always made by humans (Pricing Committee)**
  - AI independently executing price changes is **absolutely prohibited** (→ §14.1 Pricing Committee Charter)
  - Record AI recommendation adoption rate monthly to continuously improve AI model accuracy

---

## Part VII. Price Experimentation (A/B Testing)

### 7.1. Experimentation Principles

- **Rule 13.070**: Price A/B tests target **new users only**. Showing different prices to existing customers is prohibited as it damages trust

### 7.2. Experiment Design

- **Rule 13.071**: Control the following variables in price experiments

| Variable | Testable | Not Testable |
|:---------|:---------|:------------|
| **Tier composition** | ○ (feature combinations) | ✗ (price differences for same features to existing customers) |
| **Price points** | ○ (new users only) | ✗ (unfairness between existing customers) |
| **Display format** | ○ (framing, layout) | - |
| **CTA copy** | ○ | - |
| **Discount rates** | ○ (new users only) | ✗ (arbitrary per-individual discounts) |

### 7.3. Statistical Requirements

- **Rule 13.072**: Price experiments require the following statistical rigor
  - Minimum sample size: 300+ per group
  - Significance level: p < 0.05
  - Minimum experiment duration: 2 weeks (to eliminate day-of-week effects)

### 7.4. Price Experiment Maturity Levels

- **Rule 13.073**: Maturity classification for price experimentation

| Level | Description | Methods |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|
| **L1** | Gut-based | PM experience only |
| **L2** | Qualitative | Interviews, surveys |
| **L3** | Quantitative | A/B tests (statistically significant) |
| **L4** | Multi-variate optimization | Multi-Arm Bandit |
| **L5** | Autonomous optimization | ML-driven dynamic price adjustment |

### 7.5. Multi-Arm Bandit for Pricing

- **Rule 13.074**: MAB algorithms may be adopted at L4+ maturity
  - Auto-balance exploration and exploitation
  - Objective function: Revenue maximization
  - Ethical guardrail: Limit price variation for same user to ±15%

### 7.6. Price Elasticity Measurement

- **Rule 13.075**: Quantitatively measure price elasticity for optimal pricing decisions

```
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):
PED = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price)

|PED| > 1: Elastic (price-sensitive → potential revenue gain from price decrease)
|PED| < 1: Inelastic (price-insensitive → potential revenue gain from price increase)
|PED| = 1: Unit elastic

Methods: Calculate from A/B test results, or estimate via Conjoint Analysis
```

### 7.7. Causal Inference in Pricing

  - Output: Complexity Score (0.0–1.0) + Accuracy Requirement (Low/Mid/High)

Layer 2 — Dynamic Model Selection
  - Complexity Score × Accuracy Requirement → auto-mapped to model Tier
  - Considers real-time model availability + current API latency + cost
  - Fallback: auto-switch to alternative model when primary model is overloaded

Layer 3 — Real-Time Cost Accounting
  - Token count × model unit price per request → Cost per Request computed
  - Margin = (Revenue allocated from customer plan) − (Cost per Request)
  - Alert when Margin per Request falls below configured threshold

Layer 4 — Adaptive Optimization
  - Learn cost optimization strategies from 30-day request patterns
  - Identify high-cost request patterns and recommend pre-caching strategies
  - Monthly report of cost structure by plan to Pricing Committee
```

- **Rule 13.097b**: Customer Transparency Obligation for Real-Time Margin Optimization
  - Backend dynamic model switching is permitted without customer notification, provided:
    - Output quality (accuracy, response time) SLA is maintained
    - If SLA violation occurs, notify customer and issue credit refund
    - Provide dashboard where customers can confirm which model Tier is applied

- **Rule 13.097c**: Linking Margin Optimization to Pricing Design
  - "Actual margin by plan" observed via real-time optimization is used as monthly input for §3.6 Cost-to-Serve analysis
  - If a specific plan's actual margin falls **below 70% of target** for 3 consecutive months, §14.2 price change approval flow is automatically initiated

| **$500-$5,000** | Human pre-approval required (Agent Intent Preview displayed) |
| **> $5,000** | Multiple approvers + Legal review |

  - **Daily/monthly spending caps (Budget Ceiling)** must be set for agent cumulative expenditure
  - Anomaly detection: Automatically hold transactions exceeding **3x** average transaction amount of past 30 days
  - Maintain **immutable audit logs** for all autonomous transactions (→ coordinate with §14.4)

### 13.5. AI Value Metric Definition Protocol

  - When increases exceeding 20% are needed:
    1. Keep existing SKU price unchanged
    2. Release a parallel **new SKU** including AI features (AI-Enhanced edition)
    3. Provide existing customers a **12-month opt-in migration period** to the new SKU
  - Forced SKU migration (AI bundling + price increase without customer consent) is **prohibited** as an anti-pattern (→ §16.2 #42)
  - To justify AI Premium value, quantitatively demonstrate **3x or greater perceived value improvement** over existing features

- **Rule 13.140b**: Agent Licensing Model
  - Design principles when adopting per-agent license billing:

```
Agent License Pricing Structure:
1. Setup Fee: Initial cost for agent build/customization
2. Recurring License: Monthly/annual license per agent
3. Variable Component: Variable cost linked to inference cost/tool call volume
4. Maintenance: Maintenance fee absorbing model upgrades/API changes
Recommended ratio: Setup(one-time) + Recurring 60% + Variable 40%

  - Cost estimate: $5-30 / 1M tokens
  - Pricing: Enterprise / Credits-based / Outcome-Based

Routing Logic:
  - Task complexity × Accuracy requirement × Cost constraint → Automatic model selection
  - Restrict accessible Tiers based on customer plan
```

- **Rule 13.141b**: Pricing Arbitrage Prevention Protocol
  - Mandate design preventing "price arbitrage" where lower-tier plans gain access to high-cost models
  - Plan-level model access control managed via **Entitlement DB (SSOT)**, not hardcoded (→ coordinate with 300 Entitlement Gate)
  - **Rate Limit**: Set monthly token caps for Tier 2/3 model access per plan
  - Arbitrage Anomaly Detection: Auto-detect mass execution of high-cost tasks by free plan users, trigger Circuit Breaker

- **Rule 13.141c**: Model Cost Deflation Price Pass-Through Timeline
  - When a new model releases with equivalent performance to an older model but **≥30% lower cost**:
    - Within 6 months: Internally switch from old model to new (maintain customer pricing)

| Single provider **< 60%** | 🟢 Healthy | Quarterly review only |

- **Rule 13.142b**: Provider Price Shock Protocol
  - Emergency response when a foundation model provider announces **≥30% price increase within 30 days**:

```
Actions within 72 hours:
1. Run traffic migration simulation to alternative models
2. Calculate customer impact (Cost-to-Serve change rate)
3. Emergency Pricing Committee convene → determine response:
   a. Absorb (within 30 days): Accept margin compression to preserve customer trust
   b. Pass-Through (after 30-day notice): Transfer to customers per §6.2 Notification Protocol
   c. Model switch (within 60 days): Migrate to alternative provider

Customer price pass-through cap:
- Maximum pass-through per Provider-caused price increase: 10%
- If >10% pass-through required, apply §13.9 AI Premium SKU Protocol
```

- **Rule 13.142c**: Multi-Provider Cost Distribution Architecture Pricing Design
  - **Provider-Agnostic Pricing Layer**: Completely decouple customer billing units (credits, task count, etc.) from provider API specifications
  - This ensures backend provider changes do not impact customer pricing experience
  - **Provider dependency checklist** for pricing design:
    - `[ ]` Customer-facing price units are not provider-specific technical units (e.g., tokens)
    - `[ ]` Backend provider changes can be executed without frontend price changes
    - `[ ]` Same-function pricing calculation is possible with at least 2 providers

### 13.12. AI Confidence-Based & Long-Context Pricing

- **Rule 13.143a**: Design principles for linking AI model output Confidence Score to pricing

```
Confidence-Based Pricing Application Criteria:
Suitable: Domains where "accuracy" has material value (legal, medical, financial judgment)
Not Suitable: Creative content generation (confidence score itself is hard to define)

Design Pattern:
  Tier A (High-Confidence Mode): With confidence scaffolding × standard unit price
  Tier B (Base Mode): No scaffolding × standard unit price
  Delta = High-Confidence Mode Premium (recommended: ≤2x)

Mandatory Requirements:
  - Disclose the confidence definition and measurement method to customers
  - Obtain consent before use (prohibit forced billing for ambiguous features)
  - Define refund/credit-back policy for errors in advance
```

- **Rule 13.143b**: Long-Context Pricing (differentiated billing for large input contexts) design principles
  - Long-context tasks with significantly more input tokens (PDF analysis, video summarization, etc.)
    have fundamentally different cost structures; separate billing should be considered

  | Input Size | Billing Model | Example |
  |:----------|:-------------|:--------|
  | Standard (~32K tokens) | Included in standard plan | Regular chat |
  | Mid-context (32K-128K) | Additional credit consumption | Long document analysis |
  | Super-long context (128K+) | Add-on or Enterprise-only | Video / large codebase |

  - Customer-facing billing units should be abstracted to business units such as
    **"document pages"** rather than "token count"
    (→ align with §13.5 Value Metric Definition Protocol)

### 13.13. Green AI Pricing Protocol

- **Rule 13.144a**: Design principles for embedding carbon emission costs into AI inference pricing

```
Green AI Pricing Structure:

1. Carbon Cost Calculation
   - AI inference electricity consumption × PUE (data center efficiency) × carbon intensity coefficient
   - Baseline: CO₂ equivalent cost $15-80/ton (linked to market carbon price)

2. Pricing Design Options
   Option A: Standard Plan
     - Embed carbon cost in plan price (silently add 1-3% to tiered plans)
   Option B: Green Plan (Premium)
     - Dedicated infrastructure on 100% renewable energy data centers
     - +10-20% premium over Standard Plan
     - Issue emission certificates for ESG reporting
   Option C: Carbon-Neutral Plan
     - Offset all emissions including Scope 3 with digital carbon credits
     - +5-15% over Standard Plan (additional credit cost)

3. ESG Reporting Compliance
   - Disclose verified sustainability performance for CSRD (EU) / SEC Climate Disclosure Rule (US)
   - Provide Scope 3 emission data to customers in identifiable format
```

- **Rule 13.144b**: Prevention of Misleading Green AI Claims
  - Labels such as "Green", "Carbon-Neutral", or "Sustainable" must be based on **third-party certification** (ISO 14064, Gold Standard, etc.)
  - **Greenwashing is absolutely prohibited**: Unsubstantiated green claims constitute unfair competition and create regulatory risk
  - Implement proactive compliance with the EU Green Claims Directive (expected enforcement 2026)

### 13.14. Sovereign AI Pricing Protocol

- **Rule 13.145a**: Cost structure separation and price reflection driven by national AI data sovereignty regulations

| Region | Primary Regulatory Risk | Cost Impact | Pricing Response |
|:-------|:----------------------|:-----------|:----------------|
| **EU** | GDPR + EU AI Act | Regional data flow restrictions = dedicated infrastructure cost increase | EU data center dedicated plan +15-30% premium |
| **Japan** | Economic Security Act + APPI | Domestic server requirements = cost increase | Domestic data plan +10-20% premium |
| **China** | Cross-border data transfer prohibition | Domestic architecture only = cost increase | Legacy/partner model |
| **India** | DPDP Act 2023 | Data localization requirements | India region plan +8-15% premium |

- **Rule 13.145b**: Cost Pass-Through Protocol for Regional Separation

```
Sovereign AI Pricing Design Framework:

1. Cost Segregation
   - Separate into Global Cost (common infrastructure) vs. Regional Cost (region-specific)
   - Regional Cost = dedicated infrastructure + regional regulatory compliance + data localization labor

2. Sovereign Premium Calculation
   - Baseline: Global Plan standard price = 100%
   - Pass through Regional Cost increase proportionally
   - Upper limit guideline: Premiums exceeding +30% warrant re-evaluation of market entry viability

3. Sovereign Tier Modeling
   - "Regional Data Residency Add-on": Offered as an optional add-on compatible with any plan
   - "Sovereign Enterprise Plan": High-fee plan bundling dedicated infrastructure + regulatory compliance
```

- **Rule 13.145c**: Deployment Timing for Sovereign AI Pricing
  - Conduct a **"Regional Regulatory Risk Assessment"** at every new market entry and account for Sovereign costs upfront
  - If regulatory compliance costs exceed **20% of in-region projected LTV**, put deployment on hold pending legal review
  - Define **Sovereign AI Cost Checklist** as a standing agenda item in the Pricing Committee (→ align with §14.1)

### 13.15. Edge AI Inference Pricing Protocol

- **Rule 13.146**: Pricing design protocol for executing AI inference at the Edge (Cloudflare Workers AI, AWS Lambda@Edge, Fastly Compute, etc.) rather than centralized cloud

```
Edge AI Inference — 3-Layer Cost Structure:

Layer 1 — Edge Inference Cost
  - Lower latency than centralized cloud inference, but
    available model sizes are constrained (~7B/13B parameter class)
  - Cost: 20-50% lower than centralized cloud (reduced data transfer + compute efficiency)

Layer 2 — Model Routing Cost
  - Orchestration cost for dynamically routing between Edge / Cloud based on task complexity
  - Complexity classification: inference cost of a Complexity Classifier (executed with lightweight model)

Layer 3 — Data Transfer & Compliance Cost
  - Data transfer fees between Edge → Cloud
  - In Sovereign AI regulated regions, Edge processing may be mandatory and Cloud transfer prohibited
  - In this case, Edge processing costs increase and transfer to Sovereign Premium (→ align with §13.14)
```

- **Rule 13.146a**: Decision Framework for Edge vs. Cloud Pricing Design

| Architecture | Best Fit | Pricing Design |
|:------------|:--------|:--------------|
| **Full Cloud** | High-accuracy tasks, batch processing | Reflect cloud costs directly |
| **Edge-First** | Low-latency requirement, privacy-focused, offline support | Pass Edge discount (-15–30%) to customers |
| **Hybrid Routing** | Auto-routing by complexity | 2-tier billing (Edge Tier + Cloud Burst Add-on) |
| **On-Premise / Private Cloud** | Highest-sensitivity data, Sovereign AI regulated | Enterprise contract + implementation cost separate |

- **Rule 13.146b**: Value Communication for Edge AI Pricing
  - Quantitatively articulate Edge AI benefits (low latency, privacy) on the pricing page
  - Example: "Average response time 50ms → 70% faster than competitors" | "Your data never leaves your region"
  - Edge Plan can be branded as **Privacy-First Plan** or **Speed Tier** to justify a price premium

- **Rule 13.146c**: Edge AI Capability Limitations and Customer Transparency Obligations
  - Obligation to disclose model size and accuracy limitations achievable at Edge to customers upfront
  - Specify in SLA: "Edge Tier model accuracy may be up to X% lower than Cloud Tier"
  - Define compensation policy in contract for errors on high-accuracy tasks processed at Edge Tier

### 13.16. Quantum-Safe Pricing Protocol

- **Rule 13.147a**: Mandatory security design for pricing data and audit logs in preparation for practical quantum computing

```
Quantum Threats to Pricing Systems:
- RSA 2048 / ECC 256 encryption → breakable by Shor's Algorithm
- "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks are an urgent concern

NIST PQC Standards Compliance (FIPS 203/204/205, finalized 2024):
- ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber): Quantum-resistant key exchange
- ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium): Quantum-resistant digital signatures
- SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+): Hash-based signatures

Quantum-Safe Pricing DB Design:
- DB connections: TLS 1.3 + PQC hybrid encryption (classical + PQC)
- Audit log signing: ML-DSA compliant for tamper verification
- Long-term retained data (7 years): Store with PQC encryption starting now
```

- **Rule 13.147b**: Quantum-Safe Migration Roadmap (Pricing & Billing Domain)

| Phase | Timeline | Action |
|:--------|:----------|:-------|
| **Phase 1** Assessment | By 2026-Q3 | Create encryption inventory for pricing/billing systems |
| **Phase 2** Hybridization | 2026-Q4 to 2027-Q2 | Begin hybrid operation (classical + PQC) |
| **Phase 3** PQC Migration Complete | By 2027-Q4 | Migrate all pricing/audit logs to PQC compliance |
| **Phase 4** Audit | 2028+ | Annual third-party security audit (ISO 27001 aligned) |

- **Rule 13.147c**: Quantum-Safe Implementation Checklist
  - `[ ]` PQC hybrid TLS for pricing DB connections
  - `[ ]` ML-DSA signatures applied to long-term audit logs (7-year retention)
  - `[ ]` PQC-compliant electronic signatures for price change approval flows
  - `[ ]` Annual quantum-resistance evaluation of cryptographic libraries

### 13.17. Vertical AI Pricing Specialization

- **Rule 13.148a**: In regulated industries, AI feature pricing is subject to industry-specific legal constraints. Applying generic SaaS pricing without modification is prohibited.

| Industry | Applicable Regulations | Impact on Pricing Design |
|:----|:--------|:-------------|
| **Healthcare SaaS** | Medical Practitioners Act (JP) / HIPAA (US) / MDR (EU) | AI diagnostic support on an outcome basis may constitute "medical practice". Requires legal review before adoption |
| **Legal Tech** | Attorney Act (JP) / UPL Laws (US) | Outcome-based billing for legal judgments risks unauthorized legal practice. Abstraction to "reference material provision" needed |
| **FinTech / InsurTech** | Financial Instruments Act (JP) / Dodd-Frank / PSD2 (EU) | Outcome-based billing for investment decisions may require financial instruments business registration |
| **EdTech** | FERPA (US) / GDPR Article 22 (EU) | Automated learning assessment billing requires consent and transparency obligations |
| **HR Tech** | Employment Security Act (JP) / EEO Laws (US) / EU AI Act High-Risk | Outcome billing for hiring AI requires care for anti-discrimination laws and EU AI Act High-Risk classification |
| **GovTech** | Government Procurement Laws (various) | Outcome billing models may conflict with fixed-price bidding requirements |

- **Rule 13.148b**: Vertical-Specific Pricing Due Diligence Protocol
  - **Always conduct legal review** before designing a pricing model when entering a new industry vertical
  - Outcome-Based Pricing requires particularly careful review to confirm that "outcome attribution" does not violate applicable laws
  - Register industry-specific pricing constraints in Pricing Committee Knowledge Base for future reference

- **Rule 13.148c**: Vertical AI Pricing Differentiation Strategy (Convert Regulation into Premium)
  - Design regulatory compliance costs transparently as a Premium Tier
  - Example: "AI Compliance Pack (with HIPAA compliance certificate)" → +30% premium over standard plan
  - Incorporate industry certifications (e.g., ISO 27799 for Healthcare) as Enterprise Tier differentiators

### 13.18. Real-Time Competitive Intelligence Pricing

- **Rule 13.149a**: Automated competitor pricing monitoring using AI web crawlers with price response protocol

```
Competitive Intelligence Pricing System Architecture:

Collection Layer:
  - Targets: Public pricing pages / press releases / SEC Filings / App Store pricing
  - Method: Ethical web crawling (respect robots.txt + ToS verification)
  - Frequency: Pricing pages weekly / press releases real-time

Analysis Layer:
  - LLM-automated summary and impact analysis of competitor price changes
  - Auto-update of Feature-per-Dollar index (monthly)

Response Layer:
  A. Difference < 5%: No action needed (continue monitoring)
  B. Difference 5–15%: Notify Pricing Committee (discuss at next regular meeting)
  C. Difference > 15%: Trigger §6.8 AI-Triggered Price Review Protocol
  D. Competitor makes new feature free: Re-evaluate feature value and design alternative value proposition
```

- **Rule 13.149b**: Ethical Collection Guidelines for Competitive Intelligence
  - **Permitted**: Public pricing pages, press releases, SEC/securities reports
  - **Prohibited**: Scraping that violates ToS, stealth-account acquisition of internal info, obtaining intel from competitor employees (→ §15.3 Anti-Cartel)
  - Collected data is **internal only**; legal approval required for disclosure to third parties

- **Rule 13.149c**: Competitive Price Intelligence Governance
  - Add CI Manager as a standing member of the Pricing Committee
  - Data retention period: **3 years**
  - Quarterly competitive price trend report to leadership

### 13.19. Multi-Modal / Physical-Digital AI Pricing Protocol

- **Rule 13.150a**: Pricing design principles for AI products that bridge physical and digital environments — including Spatial Computing (Vision Pro, AR glasses), IoT-embedded AI, and Robotics-as-a-Service

```
Physical-Digital AI Pricing Dimensions:

Dimension 1 — Spatial Computing / XR
  - Pricing unit candidates: "per session", "per spatial scene rendered",
    "per object recognized", "per user-environment"
  - Current best practice: Session-based credits (hybrid UBP)
  - Example: $0.05/minute of AR session + $0.01/object recognition event
  - Anti-pattern: Per-device flat licensing (ignores actual usage value)

Dimension 2 — IoT / Edge-Embedded AI
  - Device-level AI inference must be billed separately from cloud orchestration
  - Billing architecture: Device Registration Fee (one-time) +
    Monthly Device License + Usage-based inference credits
  - Offline-mode handling: Pre-allocate credit budget for offline operation;
    reconcile actuals on reconnect (→ align with §13.15 Edge AI Protocol)

Dimension 3 — Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS)
  - Outcome-based billing is the gold standard: charge per task completed by robot
  - Fallback: Uptime-based billing (robot-hours operational) for early-stage deployments
    before outcome attribution is established (→ align with §2.4 Outcome-Based Pricing)
  - Include hardware depreciation amortization in Cost-to-Serve calculations
    (robots have physical wear unlike pure-software services)

Dimension 4 — Ambient AI (Always-On Environments)
  - "Ambient AI" embedded in physical spaces (smart offices, retail, healthcare)
    requires a fundamentally different pricing model: Space License
  - Space License: Per physical location / per square meter / per occupancy level
  - Combine: Space License (fixed) + AI Interaction Credits (variable)
```

- **Rule 13.150b**: Physical-Digital Pricing Compliance Considerations
  - Biometric data collected by physical AI sensors (cameras, microphones) for pricing purposes
    is subject to GDPR Article 9, CCPA, and BIPA (Illinois) — **legal review mandatory before deployment**
  - Pricing based on physical presence or behavior patterns (dwell time, gaze direction) requires
    **explicit opt-in consent** and cannot be made a condition of service
  - For healthcare physical environments: ensure pricing model does not imply medical device classification
    (→ align with §13.17 Vertical AI Pricing Specialization)

- **Rule 13.150c**: Physical-Digital Value Communication Protocol
  - Visualize physical-digital AI value as "physical equivalent savings":
    Example: "This smart shelf AI replaces 2 manual inventory checks/day × 365 = $X/year in labor"
  - ROI Calculator (§3.10) must account for physical installation costs, maintenance, and hardware refresh cycles
  - SLA for physical-digital AI must include **hardware replacement SLA**, not just software uptime

  - Obtain **explicit consent** when auto-converting free trials to paid plans

- **Rule 13.155a**: EU CRD Withdrawal Button (Mandatory, **effective June 19, 2026**)
  - Mandate implementation of a **"Withdrawal Button"** for distance contracts (including online subscriptions)
  - Design the button to complete cancellation within **the same number of steps as the signup flow**
  - Intentional friction in the cancellation flow (multi-page navigation, forced phone calls, etc.) is **absolutely prohibited**
  - For EU-facing services, **complete implementation by June 2026**

- **Rule 13.156**: CA CARL 2025 Amendment Compliance (effective 2025/7)
  - Provide cancellation means as easy as the signup process
  - Obtain **explicit and separate consent** for auto-renewals
  - Clear pre-renewal notification obligation (→ coordinate with §2.8 Auto-Renewal Compliance)

- **Rule 13.157**: Post-FTC Negative Option Rule Vacatur Response
  - Invalidated by federal appeals court in 2025, but ROSCA + state laws remain effective
  - State law compliance map: CA, NY, MA, MN, UT auto-renewal laws individually
  - **Best Practice**: Use strictest state law (CA CARL) as baseline applied nationwide
  - EU Price Indication Directive: Discount display must reference lowest price of prior **30 days**

### 15.6. AI-Specific Pricing Regulation

- **Rule 13.158**: EU AI Act Pricing Constraints

  - Update and retain an AI pricing **Risk Assessment Document** quarterly

- **Rule 13.159b**: Global Regulatory Convergence Strategy
  - Rather than managing each jurisdiction separately, **adopt the strictest regulation (Highest Common Denominator) as the global baseline**
  - Current baseline: Apply requirements of EU GDPR + EU CRD + CA CARL to all markets
  - This consolidates regulatory compliance costs and increases resilience to future regulatory change

### 15.8. Biometric & Neuro-Pricing Absolute Prohibition

- **Rule 13.160**: The collection or use of biometric, physiological, or neurological data for pricing decisions is **absolutely and unconditionally prohibited**.

```
Prohibited Data Categories for Pricing Purposes:
  - Biometric identifiers: fingerprints, retinal scans, facial geometry
  - Physiological signals: heart rate, galvanic skin response (stress indicators)
  - Neurological signals: EEG-based emotion or attention measurement
  - Gaze tracking: eye-movement or pupil dilation for price sensitivity inference
  - Voice stress analysis: emotional state inference from vocal patterns
  - Behavioral biometrics: typing rhythm, mouse movement patterns (for pricing intent only)

Legal Basis for Prohibition:
  - EU: GDPR Article 9 (special category data — requires explicit consent for processing)
  - EU: AI Act Article 5 (prohibited AI practices — emotion recognition in commercial contexts)
  - US/IL: BIPA (Biometric Information Privacy Act) — strict liability, class action risk
  - US/TX, WA: State biometric laws with similar or broader scope
  - JP: Act on Protection of Personal Information — sensitive personal information restrictions

| Stress-based willingness-to-pay | ❌ **Prohibited** | Exploitative + illegal |
| Typing/mouse biometrics | ❌ **Prohibited** | Behavioral biometric — BIPA risk |

- **Rule 13.160b**: Vendor & Tool Audit Obligation
  - Any third-party pricing, personalization, or CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) vendor
    must be audited to confirm they **do not use biometric data** in their recommendation algorithms
  - Audit frequency: **Annually** or upon vendor contract renewal
  - Include **biometric data prohibition clause** in all vendor contracts
  - If a vendor cannot confirm compliance: terminate contract within **90 days**

- **Rule 13.160c**: Internal Engineering Guardrail

### 16.3. Future Outlook

- **Zero-Click Commerce**: AI agents autonomously making purchase decisions. Machine-Readable Pricing becomes critical
- **Agent-to-Agent Negotiation**: Buyer AI and seller AI negotiate automatically. Pricing APIs and guardrail design are essential
- **Outcome-as-a-Service**: Selling "outcomes" rather than software. Price = fraction of outcome's economic value
- **Real-Time Margin Management**: Integration with AI FinOps for real-time price optimization based on usage patterns
- **Personalized Value Capture**: Personalized pricing based on per-customer Value Realization (within regulatory bounds)
- **Embedded Finance**: Embedding payments, lending, and insurance into products for transparent price experience
- **Vertical SaaS Pricing**: Industry-specific SaaS pricing. Outcome billing linked to industry-specific KPIs becomes mainstream
- **Decentralized Pricing Protocol**: Blockchain-based price oracles potentially transforming economic structures
- **Quantum-Accelerated Inference**: Quantum computing may dramatically transform AI inference costs, redefining pricing structures (post-2030s)
- **Sovereign AI Pricing**: National AI data sovereignty regulations will require region-specific model/infrastructure separation, widening regional cost structure disparities
- **Trust-Indexed Pricing**: AI explainability, audit trails, and ethics scores become the basis for pricing premiums (post-EU AI Act enforcement)
- **Carbon-Priced SaaS**: Emergence of "Green AI plans" embedding carbon emission costs into AI inference pricing. ESG measurement tightening may mandate granular price disclosures
- **Edge-Native Billing**: As AI inference distributes to the Edge, "Edge Tiers" combining geography, latency, and data sovereignty become standardized. 2-tier design alongside centralized cloud billing becomes mainstream (→ §13.15)
- **Composable Pricing (Pricing-as-a-Service)**: Pricing logic itself published as an API, enabling partners, customers, and agents to query and confirm prices in real-time — a shift toward the "Headless Commerce" model
- **Agentic ROI Metering**: Real-time metering of human FTE hours replaced by AI agents, with outcome-linked usage billing becoming mainstream (→ §3.10)
- **Neuro-Pricing / Physiological Pricing**: AI-optimized pricing anchored on eye-tracking and biometric data. **This practice poses a high risk of violating EU AI Act and GDPR Article 9 (special category data) and is absolutely prohibited**

## Part I. Philosophy of Market Validation

### 1.1. Build Trap Avoidance Principle

- **Rule 11.001**: The absolute principle is "build because there is demand," not "build because we can"
- **Rule 11.002**: Allocate more than 50% of resources in the first 3 months to "validation." Premature investment in building is prohibited
- **Build Trap Definition**: A state where progress is mistakenly measured by number of features or shipping velocity rather than user value. This constitution defines this as a critical risk
- **Rule 11.003**: Especially in the pre-PMF phase, enforce the order of "sell then build" rather than "build then sell"

### 1.2. Validated Learning

- **Rule 11.004**: All decisions must follow the cycle of "Hypothesis" → "Experiment" → "Measurement" → "Learning"
- **Rule 11.005**: Any statement of "we believe this is correct" must be treated as a hypothesis. Treating it as a conviction is prohibited
- **Lean Startup Loop**:

```
Hypothesis (Build) → Minimum Validation (Measure) → Data Analysis (Learn) → Next Hypothesis
```

- **Rule 11.006**: Learning velocity is the greatest competitive advantage. The standard cycle duration is a minimum of 2 weeks

### 1.3. Evidence Hierarchy

Market validation evidence reliability ranks as follows:

| Rank | Evidence Type | Reliability | Use in Decisions |
|:-----|:-------------|:-----------|:----------------|
| 1 | Actual purchase / payment behavior | ★★★★★ | Directly usable for investment decisions |
| 2 | Pre-order (Pre-order / LOI) | ★★★★ | Usable for market entry decisions |
| 3 | Active usage of prototype | ★★★★ | Usable for feature prioritization |
| 4 | User interviews (behavior-based) | ★★★ | Usable for hypothesis building |
| 5 | Surveys / intent research | ★★ | Directional reference only |
| 6 | Competitor existence / market trends | ★ | Context only |
| 7 | Emotional reactions ("likes", "interesting") | ✗ (invalid) | Prohibited for decision-making |

- **Rule 11.007**: Making major investment decisions based solely on Rank 5 or below evidence is prohibited
- **Rule 11.008**: Substituting evidence rank with evidence volume is prohibited (10,000 surveys < 10 actual payments)

### 1.4. Time Value of Validation

- **Rule 11.009**: The value of validation results decays over time. Making critical decisions based on validation data older than 6 months is prohibited
- **Validation Data Expiry**:

| Data Type | Expiry | Re-validation Trigger |
|:----------|:-------|:---------------------|
| Customer Interviews | 6 months | Major market environment change |
| PMF Surveys | 3 months | Competitor major update |
| Market Size Estimates | 12 months | Regulatory change / tech innovation |
| Competitive Analysis | 3 months | Competitor fundraising / M&A |
| Price Sensitivity Research | 6 months | Own feature additions / tier changes |

### 1.5. Founder-Market Fit (FMF) Evaluation

- **Rule 11.015**: Evaluate **Founder-Market Fit (FMF)** as a prerequisite for PMF. The probability of achieving PMF in domains with weak FMF is statistically significantly lower
- **FMF Definition**: A state where the founding team possesses **unique advantages for deeply understanding and solving the target market's problems** (domain experience, technical skills, network, passion)

- **Rule 11.016**: Evaluate FMF across the following 5 axes, with a recommended total score of 15 or above

| Axis | Score | Criteria |
|:-----|:------|:---------|
| **Domain Expertise** | 0-5 | 10+ years industry experience=5, 5+ years=4, 2+ years=3, personal experience only=2, none=0 |
| **Problem Proximity** | 0-5 | Experience the problem daily=5, experienced in the past=3, observed as third party=1 |
| **Unique Insight** | 0-5 | Possess market truths unknown to others=5, general knowledge only=1 |
| **Network Access** | 0-5 | Direct access to ICP company decision-makers=5, none=0 |
| **Obsession** | 0-5 | Committed to working on this problem for 10 years=5, interest level=1 |

- **FMF Score ≥ 20**: Strong FMF (highly valued by investors)
- **FMF Score 15-19**: Sufficient FMF (identify areas that can be supplemented)
- **FMF Score < 15**: Weak FMF (consider recruiting a domain expert as co-founder)

- **Rule 11.017**: When FMF is weak, prioritize "team composition change" over "learning". Recommend bringing in domain experts as co-founders, not just advisors

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Our technology is excellent so we can learn the market later" is dangerous thinking. Technology without market understanding loses direction

---

## Part II. Problem Discovery & Definition

### 2.1. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

- **Rule 11.010**: Design from the starting point of "the job the user wants to accomplish," not "product features"
- **JTBD 3-Layer Structure**:

```
Functional Job: The actual task to accomplish
    Example: Complete tax filing accurately and on time

Emotional Job: How they want to feel
    Example: Feel a sense of accomplishment without anxiety

Social Job: How they want to be perceived
    Example: Be recognized as someone who manages finances well
```

- **Rule 11.011**: Job Statements must be written in the following format
  ```
  When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]
  ```

### 2.2. Pain Severity Scoring

- **Rule 11.012**: Score discovered problems using the following criteria to determine priority

| Dimension | Points | Criteria |
|:----------|:-------|:--------|
| **Frequency** | 0-3 | Daily=3, Weekly=2, Monthly=1, Less=0 |
| **Severity** | 0-3 | Work stoppage=3, Highly inefficient=2, Minor inconvenience=1, Unnoticeable=0 |
| **Urgency** | 0-3 | Would pay now=3, If budget allows=2, If opportunity arises=1, Don't want to change=0 |
| **Dissatisfaction** | 0-3 | No alternatives=3, Very dissatisfied=2, Dissatisfied=1, Satisfied=0 |

- **Pain Score ≥ 8**: Worth pursuing
- **Pain Score 5-7**: Additional validation required
- **Pain Score < 5**: Questionable as a market opportunity

### 2.3. Problem Statement Formalization

- **Rule 11.013**: Formalize the problem to solve in the following format to ensure the entire team is solving the same problem

```
[Persona] in [situation/context]
has [problem/frustration],
currently uses [current solution],
but it is insufficient because [shortcoming].
Solving this problem is expected to achieve [quantitative effect].
```

### 2.4. Problem-Solution Gap Analysis

- **Rule 11.014**: Identifying the problem alone is insufficient. **Quantify the gap between the current solution and the ideal state**

```
Gap Score = (Ideal state satisfaction - Current satisfaction) × Frequency × Affected users

Gap Score ≥ 50: Strong market opportunity
Gap Score 20-49: Worth validating
Gap Score < 20: Low priority
```

---

## Part III. Market Sizing & Market Timing

### 3.1. TAM / SAM / SOM Definition & Calculation

- **Rule 11.020**: Before starting a business, always quantify TAM, SAM, and SOM to verify economic viability of the target segment

| Metric | Definition | Calculation Approach |
|:-------|:----------|:--------------------|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) | Entire market size with the problem | Top-down (industry reports) |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market) | Actually reachable target market | Bottom-up (segments × price) |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Realistically obtainable market | Calculated from competitive share & GTM capability |

- **Rule 11.021**: Use TAM ≥ $700M and SOM ≥ $70M as entry criteria benchmarks for major businesses (exceptions defined in Blueprint)

### 3.2. Bottom-Up Market Calculation Protocol

- **Rule 11.022**: Use top-down market reports for "reality checks." **Strategic decisions must always be based on bottom-up calculations**

```
SOM = Target users × Conversion rate × ARPU × 12 months

Example:
Target users: 500,000
Conversion rate: 3%
ARPU: $15/month
SOM = 500,000 × 0.03 × $15 × 12 = $27M/year
```

- **Rule 11.023**: Single-line top-down calculations ("the market is $1T, if we capture 1%...") are immediately rejected by investors. Always include bottom-up evidence

### 3.3. Market Growth Assessment

- **Rule 11.024**: Evaluate not just current market size but **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**
- **Benchmark**: Prioritize growth markets with CAGR ≥ 15%
- **Rule 11.025**: **New entry into markets with expected contraction (CAGR < 0%) is prohibited by default**

### 3.4. Market Timing Analysis (Why Now Protocol)

- **Rule 11.026**: According to Bill Gross's research (Idealab, 2015), the **#1 factor for startup success is timing (42%)**, exceeding team (32%) and idea (28%). Explicitly define and document "why now"

- **Why Now Canvas**:

```yaml
why_now_canvas:
  technology_shift: "What technological change makes this opportunity possible now"
  regulatory_shift: "What regulatory change is opening/restricting the market"
  behavioral_shift: "What change in user behavior is creating demand"
  economic_shift: "What macroeconomic change is altering spending patterns"
  competitive_vacuum: "Why haven't existing players captured this opportunity yet"
  urgency_evidence: "Is it still not too late a year from now? Evidence it must be now"
```

- **Rule 11.027**: If any Why Now Canvas item lacks a specific answer, reassess the timing rationale for entry
- **Anti-Pattern**: Vague timing justifications like "AI is trending" or "riding the DX wave" are invalid. Identify specific technology, regulatory, or behavioral inflection points

### 3.5. Market Structure Analysis

- **Rule 11.028**: Evaluate not just market size but the **structural characteristics** of the market

| Criterion | Favorable State | Concerning State |
|:----------|:---------------|:----------------|
| Fragmentation | Many small players | Oligopoly by 2-3 companies |
| Customer switching cost | Low (easier entry) | Extremely high |
| Regulatory barriers | Low / favorable for new entrants | Licenses/permits required |
| Technology risk | Application of established tech | Dependency on basic-research-stage tech |
| Supplier bargaining power | Multiple alternative suppliers | Single dependency (e.g., one API) |

### 3.6. Regulatory Risk Assessment Protocol

- **Rule 11.029**: Before entering regulated industries (FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, InsurTech, AI/ML), the following regulatory risk assessment **must** be conducted

```yaml
regulatory_risk_assessment:
  target_jurisdictions:
    - jurisdiction: "Japan"
      applicable_laws: ["Payment Services Act", "FIEA", "APPI", "AI Business Guidelines"]
    - jurisdiction: "EU"
      applicable_laws: ["GDPR", "EU AI Act", "PSD2/PSD3", "DORA"]
    - jurisdiction: "US"
      applicable_laws: ["CCPA/CPRA", "SEC Regulations", "HIPAA", "FTC Act Section 5"]
  license_requirements:
    required: [true|false]
    estimated_timeline: "XX months"
    estimated_cost: "$XXX"
  compliance_burden:
    level: [low|medium|high|prohibitive]
    ongoing_cost_percentage: "XX% of revenue"  # Ongoing compliance cost
  regulatory_trajectory:
    trend: [loosening|stable|tightening]
    upcoming_changes: "Anticipated regulatory changes for 2026-2027"
  go_no_go_decision:
    proceed: [true|false]
    conditions: "Prerequisites for proceeding"
```

- **Rule 11.029a**: If the regulatory risk assessment determines `compliance_burden: prohibitive`, either abandon entry or complete regulatory clearance **before PMF validation**
- **Anti-Pattern**: "Build the product first, then figure out regulations" carries total development resource loss risk. In regulated industries, Regulatory PMF (regulatory compliance) is a prerequisite for market PMF

### 3.7. Regulatory Sandbox Protocol

- **Rule 11.160**: When entering regulated industries (FinTech, HealthTech, AI/ML, InsurTech), evaluate the availability and applicability of **Regulatory Sandboxes** prior to entry
- **Regulatory Sandbox Definition**: An institutional framework under regulatory authority supervision that temporarily relaxes or exempts regulations, enabling controlled experimentation with innovative products and business models

- **Rule 11.161**: Sandbox participation decision criteria

| Criterion | Sandbox Recommended | Standard Regulatory Compliance Sufficient |
|:----------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Compliance with existing regulations | Unclear / gray zone | Clearly compliant |
| Entry timeline | Regulatory clearance > 12 months | Addressable within 6 months |
| Investor signal | Sandbox participation enhances credibility | Already regulatory-cleared |
| Industry maturity | Regulatory framework not yet established | Established regulatory environment |

- **Rule 11.162**: Effects of Sandbox participation on PMF validation
  - **Investor Signal**: Sandbox participation serves as strong evidence of regulatory risk mitigation for investors
  - **Regulatory Clearance Acceleration**: Direct dialogue with regulators accelerates license/permit acquisition for full-scale deployment
  - **Validation Precision Enhancement**: Validation under near-real-world conditions improves PMF determination accuracy
  - **Constraint**: Sandbox validation results are geographically and temporally limited; re-validation is required at scale

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Sandboxes are only for large enterprises" is a misconception. Many countries (Japan, UK, Singapore, UAE, etc.) have established Sandbox programs for startups

## Part IV. Customer Discovery Process

### 4.1. Customer Interview Protocol

- **Rule 11.030**: Conduct a minimum of **20 customer interviews** before starting product development
- **Rule 11.031**: Enforce the following prohibited practices in interviews

| Prohibited Practice | Reason |
|:-------------------|:-------|
| Leading questions ("Do you think...?") | Reinforces confirmation bias |
| Stating your product idea first | Respondent will agree out of courtesy |
| Hypothetical questions ("Would you...?") | Intent and behavior diverge |
| Asking for solution feedback | Becomes validation, not discovery |
| Trying to cover everything in one interview | Depth suffers, answers become superficial |

- **The Mom Test Principle**: Dig into problems without discussing your idea. Ask only questions that even your own mother couldn't lie about

### 4.2. Customer Interview Question Design

**Recommended question patterns:**

```
Phase 1: Problem Existence Verification
1. "What is the hardest thing about [problem domain]?"
2. "When was the last time that problem occurred? Tell me about it"

Phase 2: Deep-dive into Current Solutions
3. "How do you currently solve that problem?"
4. "What's inconvenient about that approach?"
5. "How much do you pay for that solution? (time, money, effort)"

Phase 3: Willingness to Pay Verification
6. "Have you actually spent money trying to solve this problem?"
7. "If a better solution existed, would you abandon your current approach?"
8. "If it existed tomorrow, how much would you pay?"
```

### 4.3. Early Adopter Identification Protocol

- **Rule 11.032**: Focus initial users exclusively on "Early Adopters." Simultaneously targeting the mass market is prohibited
- **5 Conditions for Early Adopters**:
  1. Strongly aware of the problem
  2. Already trying to solve it (taking action)
  3. Paying money for a solution (or willing to)
  4. Tolerant of an incomplete solution
  5. Has time and willingness to provide feedback

- **Rule 11.033**: Use reverse engineering to identify Early Adopters

```
1. Collect competitor product reviews (complaint comments)
2. Find users discussing problems on forums, Slack, and Discord
3. Identify users actively searching for similar solutions on ProductHunt, Reddit, etc.
4. Find users asking questions at industry conference Q&A sessions
```

### 4.4. Customer Interview Analysis Process

- **Rule 11.034**: Structurize notes within 24 hours of an interview and record in the following format

```yaml
interview_record:
  id: "INT-001"
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  persona_match: [high|medium|low]
  early_adopter_score: 0-5  # Number of 5 conditions met
  top_pain: "Concise description of most severe problem"
  pain_severity_score: 0-12  # Scoring from §2.2
  current_solution: "Current alternative solution"
  switching_cost: [high|medium|low]
  willingness_to_pay: [confirmed|likely|unlikely|no]
  stated_budget: "$XX/month"
  key_quote: "Important quote (verbatim)"
  signals:
    - type: [strong_positive|positive|neutral|negative|strong_negative]
      category: [pain|solution|pricing|timing|competition]
      note: "Specific insight"
  follow_up: "Next action"
```

### 4.5. Signal Strength Scoring (Interview Signal Aggregation)

- **Rule 11.035**: To elevate individual interview "insights" to organizational decision-making, aggregate signal strength

```
Signal Strength = (Strong Positive × 3 + Positive × 2 + Neutral × 0
                   + Negative × -1 + Strong Negative × -3) / Interview count

Signal Strength ≥ 2.0: Strong market signal → Proceed to MVP development
Signal Strength 1.0-1.9: Moderate → Conduct 10 additional interviews
Signal Strength < 1.0: Weak → Reconsider problem definition
```

### 4.6. AI-Augmented Interview Analysis

- **Rule 11.036**: When using AI for interview analysis, follow these protocols
  - AI transcription (Whisper etc.) for full text conversion is recommended
  - AI sentiment analysis and keyword extraction are **auxiliary tools**
  - **Prohibited**: Finalizing hypotheses based solely on AI analysis results. Human interpretation and verification are mandatory
  - AI-detected patterns (e.g., "15 of 20 interviewees mentioned the same frustration") are recorded as quantitative evidence

### 4.7. Community-Led Validation Protocol

- **Rule 11.037**: In DevTool, OSS, and B2D (Business-to-Developer) markets, leverage **community signals** as validation evidence in addition to traditional interviews

| Community Signal | Measurement Method | PMF Correlation |
|:----------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| **GitHub Star Growth Rate** | Weekly Star increase count | Medium (Vanity Metric risk) |
| **Unique Issue/PR Contributors** | Monthly unique Contributor count | High (actual engagement) |
| **Discord/Slack DAU** | Community platform DAU | High |
| **StackOverflow Question Count** | Monthly new question growth trend | Medium |
| **User-Generated Content** | Spontaneous blog post/tutorial count | Very High |
| **Word-of-Mouth NPS** | Recommendation rate within community | Very High |

- **Rule 11.038**: Community-led validation success criteria
  - **Early Stage (0-6 months)**: Unique Contributors ≥ 20/month, Discord/Slack DAU ≥ 50
  - **Growth Stage (6-12 months)**: User-generated content ≥ 5/month, community-originated bug reports ≥ 30%
  - **Anti-Pattern**: Validation based solely on GitHub Stars is a "Vanity Metric Trap". Always combine with usage frequency and Contributor count

- **Rule 11.038a**: **AI-Driven Community Demand Mining**
  - Leverage AI semantic search to automatically extract pain points from Reddit, Discord, Slack, HackerNews, StackOverflow, and similar communities
  - **Method**: Use LLM-based keyword clustering to automatically classify "dissatisfaction with current tools," "exploration of alternatives," and "specific workflow frustrations"
  - **Search keyword patterns**: `"current tool sucks"`, `"is there a way to"`, `"looking for alternative"`, `"frustrated with"`, `"wish there was"`
  - **Output format**: Create a heat map of Pain Point × Frequency × Sentiment Intensity and use as supplementary data for Pain Severity Score (§2.2)
  - **Constraints**: AI mining results are "hypothesis seeds" and must be validated through human interviews (§4.1). Confirming hypotheses based solely on mining results is prohibited
  - **Anti-Pattern**: "AI found the pain point so validation is unnecessary" is a variant of Synthetic Research Overreliance (§15.2). Always conduct triangulation with real users

### 4.8. Dynamic ICP Refinement Protocol

- **Rule 11.039**: ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) is **not a static definition but a living document that is continuously refined based on validation data**

```
ICP Refinement Cycle (Monthly Execution):

1. Data Collection: Collect attributes of new and churned customers from the past 30 days
2. Pattern Analysis:
   - Identify attributes common to high-LTV customers
   - Identify attributes common to early-churn customers
   - Extract characteristics of cohorts with high PMF Composite Score
3. ICP Update:
   - "Must-Have" attributes (characteristics held by 90%+ of PMF-achieved cohorts)
   - "Nice-to-Have" attributes (characteristics held by 60-89% of PMF-achieved cohorts)
   - "Disqualify" attributes (characteristics held by 60%+ of early-churn cohorts)
4. GTM Reflection:
   - Update ad targeting and sales lists
   - Recalibrate ICP Scoring Model (see 200_go_to_market.md)
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "ICP is written once in the business plan and never changed" is dangerous. Ignoring market feedback in ICP definition is the root cause of missed opportunities

---

## Part V. Hypothesis Structuring & Prioritization

### 5.1. Assumption Map (Hypothesis Mapping)

- **Rule 11.040**: Identify all "critical yet unvalidated assumptions" and place them in a priority matrix

```
        High Risk (High Importance)
              │
   Top Priority│   Monitor
  (Critical)   │  (Watch)
              │
  ─────────────┼────────────
  Unvalidated  │        Validated
              │
   Defer       │   Treat as Given
              │  (Established)
              │
        Low Risk (Low Importance)
```

### 5.2. Leap of Faith Assumption Identification

- **Rule 11.041**: Explicitly identify the "Leap of Faith" assumptions on which the entire business depends
  - **Value Hypothesis**: Will users actually use this product? (Demand existence)
  - **Growth Hypothesis**: How will new users be acquired? (Channel existence)
  - **Revenue Hypothesis**: Will users pay a fair price for this product? (WTP existence)

### 5.3. Hypothesis Log Mandate

- **Rule 11.042**: Track all major hypotheses in a hypothesis log within the Blueprint

| Column | Content |
|:-------|:--------|
| Hypothesis ID | H-001 format |
| Hypothesis Content | Specific description |
| Category | Value / Growth / Revenue / Technical / Legal |
| Importance | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| Status | Unvalidated / Validating / Validated / Refuted |
| Validation Method | Experiment design |
| Success Criteria | Pre-defined threshold |
| Results | Data and insights |
| Learning Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Next Action | Next step description |

### 5.4. Riskiest Assumption Test (RAT)

- **Rule 11.043**: Test the riskiest assumption (Most Critical + Most Unknown) first
- Tackling all hypotheses simultaneously is prohibited. Validate sequentially in RAT order
- RAT execution protocol:
  1. Identify "Critical × Unvalidated" hypotheses from the assumption map
  2. Design an experiment that can **validate in the shortest time** (maximum 2 weeks)
  3. **Pre-define** success/failure criteria for the experiment
  4. Record results in the hypothesis log
  5. Proceed to the next RAT

---

## Part VI. Minimum Viable / Lovable Product Design

### 6.1. MVP Definition Clarification

- **Rule 11.050**: Define MVP not as "minimum feature set" but as "the smallest experiment unit for the fastest learning"
- **Rule 11.051**: Define MVP types and their use cases as follows

| MVP Type | Description | Use Case | Validation Period |
|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:-----------------|
| **Concierge MVP** | Deliver service manually | Validate demand & willingness | 2-4 weeks |
| **Wizard of Oz MVP** | Appears automated, manually executed | Validate UX & feasibility simultaneously | 4-6 weeks |
| **Landing Page MVP** | Measure response rates with LP only | Validate demand & messaging | 1-2 weeks |
| **Prototype MVP** | Interactive mockup | Validate UX | 2-4 weeks |
| **Pre-order MVP** | Sell before developing | Highest validation of willingness to pay | 2-4 weeks |
| **Fake Door MVP** | Place UI/CTA for non-existent feature | Quantitative measurement of feature demand | 1-2 weeks |
| **Email-First MVP** | Deliver value via email/newsletter | Validate content value | 4-8 weeks |
| **API-First MVP** | API only, no product | Validate technical demand (B2B) | 4-6 weeks |
| **AI-Magnet MVP** | Small free AI tool solving one target pain point | Target attraction, usage data collection, Pain hypothesis validation | 2-4 weeks |

### 6.2. MLP (Minimum Lovable Product) Protocol

- **Rule 11.052**: For B2C and markets where experiential differentiation is critical, aim for **MLP (Minimum Lovable Product)** beyond MVP
- **MVP vs MLP Difference**:
  - **MVP**: Validates "Does it work? (Functional)" → Confirming the problem exists
  - **MLP**: Validates "Does it delight? (Delightful)" → Confirming emotional differentiation
- **MLP Design Principles**:
  - Keep feature count minimal while **maximizing core experience quality**
  - Metrics: NPS ≥ 50 and "Would recommend to a friend" 7+ points ≥ 40%

### 6.3. Prototype Fidelity Matrix

- **Rule 11.053**: Select appropriate prototype fidelity based on validation objectives

| Fidelity | Example Tools | Validation Target | Appropriate Scenario |
|:---------|:-------------|:-----------------|:-------------------|
| **Lo-Fi** | Paper sketches, Whimsical | Information architecture, flows | Initial hypothesis validation |
| **Mid-Fi** | Figma wireframes | UI structure, navigation | Usability testing |
| **Hi-Fi** | Figma prototypes | Visuals, interactions | Investor demos, user testing |
| **Functional** | No-code / actual code | Technical feasibility, real usage | Pre-PMF proof |

### 6.4. MVP Scope Limitation Protocol

- **Rule 11.054**: Features in an MVP must be limited to "the minimum set that can validate one core value hypothesis"
- **Rule 11.055**: MVP development period is **maximum 8 weeks**. If exceeded, reduce scope
- **Rule 11.056**: Document "what will be learned" from the MVP before development begins. Starting development with vague goals is prohibited

```yaml
mvp_charter:
  hypothesis_id: "H-001"
  learning_goal: "Do target users have willingness to pay $XX/month for solving problem XX"
  mvp_type: "concierge"
  success_criteria: "3 out of 5 users agree to a paid contract"
  failure_criteria: "1 or fewer out of 5 → reconsider problem definition"
  max_duration: "4 weeks"
  max_budget: "$5,000"
```

### 6.5. Smoke Test Protocol

- **Rule 11.057**: Conduct the following smoke tests before building to verify rationality of the entry decision

```
Smoke Test Success Criteria (Standard Values):
- LP email collection rate ≥ 15%
- LP paid waitlist registration rate ≥ 5%
- Interview pre-purchase intent (Signed LOI) ≥ 5
- Early access applications ≥ 100 (within 30 days)
- Fake Door CTR ≥ 5%
```

### 6.6. Pre-PMF Pricing Validation Protocol

- **Rule 11.058**: Even during the PMF phase, do not defer pricing as "we'll decide later." Conduct **initial price sensitivity validation**. Detailed pricing strategy is delegated to `400_pricing_strategy.md`, but the minimum pre-PMF validation is defined in this section

- **Rule 11.059**: Pre-PMF pricing validation in 3 steps

```
Step 1: Simplified Van Westendorp (2-Question Version)
  Add 2 questions during interviews:
  Q1: "What is the maximum you would pay per month without feeling dissatisfied?"
  Q2: "At what monthly price would you feel it's 'too expensive'?"
  → The intersection of Q1 and Q2 becomes the initial "optimal price range" hypothesis

Step 2: Fake Price Test
  Present pricing on LP or Fake Door and measure CTR/conversion:
  - CTR with price shown ≥ 3%: Price range is within acceptable limits
  - Difference from CTR without price ≥ 50%: Strong price resistance. Re-validation needed

Step 3: Anchor Price Experiment
  Present actual pricing to Design Partners/early adopters and classify reactions:
  - "Signs contract without mentioning price": Strong WTP
  - "Signs contract after negotiation": Moderate WTP
  - "Declines due to price": Price is the primary blocker
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "First achieve PMF, then figure out pricing" creates backtrack risk at the Unit Economics Gate (§8.4). Price validation should run in parallel with PMF validation

---

## Part VII. PMF Measurement & Determination

### 7.1. PMF Definition

- **Rule 11.060**: Define PMF as follows
  - **Qualitative Definition**: "A state where the product meets the needs of a specific market, users voluntarily continue using it, and recommend it to others"
  - **Quantitative Definition**: A state where the PMF Composite Score (below) exceeds the threshold

### 7.2. PMF Composite Score

- **Rule 11.061**: Calculate a PMF Composite Score as a weighted average of multiple metrics. **Declaring PMF based on a single metric is prohibited**

```
PMF Composite Score = (Sean Ellis Score × 0.30)
                    + (Retention Score × 0.25)
                    + (NPS Score × 0.15)
                    + (Organic Growth Score × 0.15)
                    + (Revenue Quality Score × 0.15)

Score conversion for each metric (0-100):
- Sean Ellis: "Very Disappointed" % × 2.5 (40% = 100, 0% = 0)
- Retention: D30 Retention ÷ Industry standard × 100 (standard = 100)
- NPS: (NPS + 100) ÷ 2 (NPS 100 = 100, NPS -100 = 0)
- Organic Growth: Organic % × (100/30) (30% = 100)
- Revenue Quality: Paid Conversion % × segment coefficient

PMF Composite Score ≥ 70: PMF Achieved
PMF Composite Score 50-69: PMF Approaching (focused improvement)
PMF Composite Score < 50: PMF Not Achieved
```

### 7.3. Key PMF Measurement Metrics

| Metric | PMF Threshold | Calculation Method |
|:-------|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Sean Ellis Test** | "Very disappointed" ≥ 40% | Survey (n ≥ 50) |
| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | ≥ +50 (Consumer) / ≥ +30 (B2B) | Recommendation intent 0-10 survey |
| **Retention Curve** | Slope converges to horizontal | Cohort-based retention chart |
| **Organic Growth Rate** | ≥ 30% of new acquisition is organic | Channel-based aggregation |
| **Engagement Depth** | DAU/MAU ≥ 20% (SNS/messaging) | Active user ratio |
| **Paid Conversion** | Free→Paid ≥ 2% (PLG) | Conversion tracking |

### 7.4. Superhuman PMF Engine (4-Step Iterative Protocol)

- **Rule 11.062**: Adopt the **PMF Engine** systematized by Rahul Vohra (Superhuman CEO) to manage PMF as a "continuously improvable score" rather than a "feeling"

**4-Step Iterative Process:**

```
Step 1: Survey
  Send the following 4 questions to 50+ actual users:
  Q1: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"
      □ Very disappointed □ Somewhat disappointed □ Not disappointed □ No longer using
  Q2: "What type of person do you think would benefit most from this product?"
  Q3: "What is the main benefit you receive from this product?"
  Q4: "How can we improve this product for you?"

Step 2: Segment
  Identify High-Expectation Customers (HXC) who answered "Very disappointed" to Q1.
  Discover HXC persona patterns from Q2 responses.
  Filter out feedback from non-HXC users.

Step 3: Analyze
  From Q3, identify "why HXC love it" → Strengthen as core value
  From Q4, identify "blockers for the somewhat disappointed" → Target for improvement
  However, improvements must not compromise HXC experience.

Step 4: Implement
  Allocate 50% of the roadmap to "strengthening core value" and 50% to "removing blockers."
  After the next sprint, re-run Step 1 and track score changes.
```

- **Rule 11.063**: The PMF Engine must cycle **at least once per month**. PMF is not a one-time achievement but must be continuously improved

### 7.5. B2B vs B2C PMF Determination Branching Protocol

- **Rule 11.064**: PMF measurement methods and thresholds differ fundamentally between B2B and B2C. Follow the branching table below

| Metric | B2B SaaS | B2C Consumer | B2B2C / Marketplace |
|:-------|:---------|:------------|:-------------------|
| **Sean Ellis Threshold** | ≥ 40% (n ≥ 30) | ≥ 40% (n ≥ 100) | Supply: ≥ 35%, Demand: ≥ 40% |
| **NPS** | ≥ +30 | ≥ +50 | Net ≥ +40 |
| **D30 Retention** | ≥ 80% | ≥ 25% | Supply: ≥ 60%, Demand: ≥ 30% |
| **Organic Growth** | ≥ 20% | ≥ 30% | Demand-leading OK |
| **Revenue Signal** | 3+ paid contracts | Free→Paid ≥ 2% | Stable Take Rate |
| **Unique Metric** | Logo Churn ≤ 5%/month | DAU/MAU ≥ 20% | Liquidity Score ≥ 0.3 |
| **Min Validation Sample** | 10+ companies | 500+ users | Supply 50+, Demand 200+ |

### 7.6. Retention Curve Analysis Protocol

- **Rule 11.065**: Monitor cohort-based retention curves weekly, verifying the following

```
Healthy Retention Curve Characteristics:
1. After initial steep drop (post Day 1), curve converges horizontally
2. D30 Retention exceeds industry standards:
   - SNS/Messaging: ≥ 25%
   - SaaS (Professional): ≥ 80%
   - E-commerce: ≥ 20% (3-month repurchase rate)
   - Gaming: ≥ 15%
   - FinTech: ≥ 40%
3. Cohorts show an improving trend (latest cohort > older cohorts)
4. Power User segment (top 10%) has exceptionally high retention (ecosystem "nucleus")
```

### 7.7. Cohort-Level PMF Analysis

- **Rule 11.066**: Overall PMF scores risk "good cohorts masking bad cohorts." **Cohort-level PMF analysis** is mandatory
- Cohort segmentation axes:
  - By acquisition channel (Organic / Paid / Referral)
  - By acquisition period (monthly cohort)
  - By persona (ICP match score)
  - By geography
- **Rule 11.067**: Even if PMF is achieved in a specific cohort (e.g., Organic × high ICP match), if other cohorts remain below threshold, record as "Segment PMF" and defer overall PMF declaration

### 7.8. False PMF Signal Vigilance Protocol

- **Rule 11.068**: The following situations are treated as "false PMF signals" and must not be mistaken for PMF achievement

| False Signal | Reason | Correct Response |
|:------------|:-------|:----------------|
| Only friends/acquaintances are using it | Usage driven by social pressure | Re-validate with 50+ complete strangers |
| High usage only during free trial | Price sensitivity untested | Re-measure with paid conversion rate |
| Temporary spike after PR/buzz | Sustainability unverified | Judge by 1-month retention |
| Event-dependent usage | Not reproducible | Measure non-event usage rate |
| "Wonderful" from investors/advisors | Not market representative | Re-validate with ICP-matched users |
| Single large enterprise contract | Reproducibility unverified | Confirm reproducibility with 3+ same-segment companies |
| Excitement about AI features | Possible Novelty Effect | Judge by 2-month continued usage rate |
| High initial activation | Temporary onboarding effect | Judge by D14/D30 essential usage rate |

### 7.9. Leading vs Lagging PMF Metrics

- **Rule 11.069**: Classify PMF metrics into Leading (leading) and Lagging (lagging), running fast feedback loops with leading indicators

| Leading Indicators | Lagging Indicators |
|:------------------|:------------------|
| Aha Moment reach rate | D30 Retention |
| Time-to-Value (TtV) | NPS |
| Core feature usage rate (within DAU) | Sean Ellis Score |
| Support ticket sentiment | Logo Churn Rate |
| Referral intent (Q: Would recommend?) | Organic Growth % |
| Session Depth (avg session depth) | NRR (Net Revenue Retention) |
| PQL Conversion Rate | Expansion MRR Growth Rate |

### 7.10. Marketplace & Network Effect PMF Protocol

- **Rule 11.075**: For marketplace-type products, **measure Supply-side and Demand-side PMF independently**. PMF on only one side is treated as PMF not achieved

| Metric | Supply Side | Demand Side | Overall |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|:--------|
| **Sean Ellis** | ≥ 35% | ≥ 40% | Net ≥ 38% |
| **Retention** | ≥ 60% (D30) | ≥ 30% (D30) | Weighted average |
| **Liquidity Score** | — | — | ≥ 0.3 |
| **Time to Match** | — | — | ≤ 50% of industry standard |
| **Take Rate Stability** | — | — | 3 consecutive months CV ≤ 10% |

- **Rule 11.076**: Marketplace "Chicken-and-Egg" Problem Resolution Protocol

```
Chicken-and-Egg Resolution Strategies (Priority Order):

1. Supply-First: Secure supply side first (applicable: content/service marketplaces)
   - Quantitative target: Supply ≥ 50 units at launch
   - Methods: Free initial listing, concierge onboarding

2. Single-Player Mode: Provide value without the network
   - Example: OpenTable (reservation management tool value)

3. Constrained Launch: Launch with geographic/categorical constraints
   - Start from narrow segments where Liquidity is easier to achieve

4. Subsidized Demand: Acquire initial users with incentives (coupons, etc.)
   - Warning: Judge PMF by Retention after incentives end
```

- **Rule 11.077**: Marketplace PMF **Liquidity Score** formula

```
Liquidity Score = Transactions / (Listings × Searches)

Liquidity Score ≥ 0.3: Healthy Marketplace
  → Supply-Demand matching is functioning
Liquidity Score 0.1-0.29: Improvement needed
  → Search accuracy and listing quality improvements required
Liquidity Score < 0.1: Critical
  → Business model redesign required
```

### 7.11. Platform & API Product PMF Protocol

- **Rule 11.078**: PMF for developer-facing products (API, SDK, Platform) has fundamentally different measurement metrics from consumer-facing products

| Metric | PMF Threshold Target | Calculation Method |
|:-------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| **API Call Growth Rate** | MoM ≥ 15% | Monthly API call count |
| **Developer Retention (D90)** | ≥ 70% | Active developers after 90 days |
| **Time to First API Call** | ≤ 30 min | From signup to first API call |
| **Integration Depth** | ≥ 3 endpoints used | Average endpoints used per developer |
| **3rd Party App Count** | ≥ 10 (platform) | Integrations built by external developers |
| **NPS (Developer NPS)** | ≥ +40 | Developer survey |

- **Rule 11.079**: Platform PMF unique metric — **Developer Experience Score (DXS)**

```
Developer Experience Score (DXS) Calculation:

DXS = (Docs Quality × 0.25)
    + (Time to Hello World × 0.25)
    + (Error Message Clarity × 0.15)
    + (SDK/CLI Usability × 0.20)
    + (Community Support Quality × 0.15)

Each metric: Scored 1-5 via developer survey (n ≥ 30), converted to 100-point scale

DXS ≥ 80: Excellent DX (Stripe/Twilio level)
DXS 60-79: Room for improvement
DXS < 60: DX is the PMF bottleneck
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Developers will use it if the documentation exists" is false. An API where Hello World cannot be reached within 20 minutes is not evaluation-worthy

### 7.12. Expansion Revenue & NRR as PMF Signal

- **Rule 11.163**: In the post-PMF scaling phase, track **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** as a lagging indicator measuring PMF sustainability

```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churn MRR) / Starting MRR × 100

NRR ≥ 130%: Best-in-class (Snowflake/Twilio level)
NRR 110-129%: Healthy PMF persistence
NRR 100-109%: PMF maintenance borderline
NRR < 100%: PMF Erosion indicator → Activate §12.4 Early Warning System
```

- **Rule 11.164**: Classify Expansion Revenue components to evaluate PMF "depth"

| Expansion Type | Definition | PMF Implication |
|:--------------|:-----------|:----------------|
| **Seat Expansion** | User count increase within same customer | Product virality |
| **Tier Upgrade** | Migration to higher-priced plan | Feature value recognition growth |
| **Usage Growth** | Usage-based billing volume increase | Core workflow entrenchment |
| **Cross-sell** | Purchase of additional products/modules | Platform value expansion |

- **Rule 11.165**: If NRR < 100% persists for 3 consecutive months, treat as "Revenue PMF Erosion" regardless of PMF Composite Score, and activate the §12.5 response protocol

### 7.13. PLG-SLG Hybrid PMF Protocol

- **Rule 11.166**: In 2026, the binary opposition between PLG (Product-Led Growth) and SLG (Sales-Led Growth) has been resolved. Measure PMF holistically as **Product-Led Sales (PLS)**

- **Product-Qualified Lead (PQL) Definition & Activation Metrics**:

```
PQL Definition Framework:
  PQL = (Usage Frequency ≥ X/week) AND (Core Feature Usage ≥ Y types) AND (Last Login ≤ Z days)

  Example (B2B SaaS):
  - Login 3+ times per week
  - Use 3+ core features
  - 2+ team members active
  - Login within last 7 days

  PQL Conversion Rate (PQL→Paid) ≥ 15%: Healthy PLS
  PQL Conversion Rate < 5%: PQL definition recalibration needed
```

- **Rule 11.167**: Track **Natural Rate of Growth (NRG)** as an indicator of autonomous product growth

```
NRG = Annual Revenue Growth Rate × Organic Channel Ratio × PLG-Attributed Revenue Ratio

NRG ≥ 50%: Strong autonomous growth (Slack/Zoom level)
NRG 20-49%: Moderate (Sales complement effective)
NRG < 20%: PLG motion not functioning
```

- **Rule 11.168**: PLG→PLS transition decision criteria

| Transition Trigger | Threshold |
|:------------------|:----------|
| Enterprise inquiries from free users | 5+ per month |
| Average Contract Value (ACV) | $25K+ deals emerging |
| Security/compliance requirements | SOC2/HIPAA demands |
| Average ACV of PQL→Paid conversions | 3x+ Self-serve |

- **Rule 11.169**: **Behavioral Cohort Analysis** is mandatory as a complement to time-series-based cohort analysis
  - In addition to traditional monthly cohorts (by signup month), compare Retention between **cohorts that performed specific actions** and **those that did not**
  - Identify "activation behaviors" (actions that lead to the Aha Moment) and use them to optimize onboarding flows
  - **Smile Curve**: A pattern where Retention stabilizes or rises after initial decline is a strong signal of deepening PMF

### 7.14. Vertical SaaS & Embedded Product PMF Protocol

- **Rule 11.170**: **Vertical SaaS** (industry-specific SaaS) PMF must be measured with different metrics than horizontal SaaS

| Metric | Vertical SaaS PMF Threshold | Difference from Horizontal SaaS |
|:------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| **Workflow Completion Rate** | ≥ 80% | Full business workflow completion (partial use insufficient) |
| **Industry-Specific NPS** | Industry avg +20pt | NPS benchmarks differ by industry (healthcare vs IT) |
| **Regulatory Compliance Rate** | 100% | Full industry regulatory compliance is a prerequisite |
| **System of Record Adoption Rate** | ≥ 50% | Customer adopts as SoR (official record system) |
| **D90 Retention** | ≥ 85% | Business systems are difficult to switch short-term |

- **Rule 11.171**: **Embedded Product** (Embedded FinTech, Embedded Insurance, etc.) PMF measurement

| Metric | PMF Threshold | Calculation Method |
|:------|:-------------|:------------------|
| **API Integration Depth** | ≥ 3 endpoints used | Average integration depth per partner |
| **Transaction Volume Growth Rate** | MoM ≥ 20% | Monthly transaction count |
| **Partner Retention (D180)** | ≥ 90% | Partner company 180-day retention rate |
| **End-User Activation Rate** | ≥ 30% | End-user activation rate via partners |
| **Revenue per Partner** | Monthly growth | Monthly revenue trend per partner |

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Evaluating Vertical SaaS with the same PMF metrics as horizontal SaaS" causes critical metrics like Workflow Completion Rate and System of Record adoption to be overlooked

### 7.15. PMF Spectrum (Progressive PMF Model)

- **Rule 11.180**: PMF is not a binary "achieved/not achieved" determination but must be managed as a **4-stage spectrum**. Each stage has distinct priority metrics and activities

| Stage | Name | ARR Range | State Definition | Priority Metrics | Priority Activities |
|:------|:-----|:----------|:----------------|:----------------|:-------------------|
| **S1** | **Nascent** | $0-$500K | 3-5 Design Partners confirm problem severity. Initial value hypothesis is validated | Pain Severity Score, LOI count, Design Partner satisfaction | Customer discovery, RAT, Concierge MVP |
| **S2** | **Developing** | $500K-$5M | Repeatable sales channels are emerging. Churn is high but learning velocity is high | PMF Composite Score, Churn rate, CAC by channel | GTM motion establishment, ICP refinement, pricing validation |
| **S3** | **Strong** | $5M-$25M | Predictable Unit Economics (NRR > 110%, CAC Payback < 18 months). Demand begins to exceed supply capacity | NRR, Burn Multiple, CAC Payback Period | Scale infrastructure, team expansion, multi-channel optimization |
| **S4** | **Extreme** | $25M+ | Self-reinforcing growth. Multiple product lines and geographic expansion are in scope | Revenue Growth Rate, Gross Margin, NRG | Multi-product, international expansion, platformization |

- **Rule 11.181**: Stage transition criteria

```
S1 → S2 Transition Conditions:
□ PMF Composite Score ≥ 50
□ Paying customers ≥ 5 (B2B) / 100 users (B2C)
□ Repeatability confirmed in at least 1 acquisition channel

S2 → S3 Transition Conditions:
□ PMF Composite Score ≥ 70
□ NRR ≥ 110% (B2B SaaS)
□ CAC Payback Period ≤ 18 months
□ Monthly Churn ≤ 5% (B2C) / ≤ 3% (B2B)

S3 → S4 Transition Conditions:
□ PMF Composite Score ≥ 80 (stable for 3 quarters)
□ All §8.1 transition criteria met
□ Organization has evolved beyond founder dependency
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Stage skipping" — attempting to jump from S1 (Nascent) to S4 (Extreme) is prohibited. Each stage's foundation is a prerequisite for the next

### 7.16. Reverse Trial Validation Protocol

- **Rule 11.182**: Include **Reverse Trial** as an evaluation target for PLG/PLS validation models
- **Reverse Trial Definition**: A model that grants users **full premium feature access from signup** and downgrades them to a free plan after the trial period ends. Complements the weaknesses of traditional Free Trial and Freemium models

```
Reverse Trial Design Principles:

1. Full feature access period: 14-30 days (adjust based on product complexity)
2. Post-downgrade retained features: Maintain 50%+ of core value (complete lockout prohibited)
3. Psychological design:
   - Loss Aversion: Leverage the feeling of "losing" features after full experience
   - Habit formation: 2+ weeks of usage embeds the product in workflows
4. Measurement metrics:
   - Trial→Paid conversion rate: ≥ 25% (must significantly exceed standard Freemium's 5-10%)
   - Post-downgrade DAU retention: ≥ 40% (confirm users don't completely disengage)
   - Time-to-Aha: Aha Moment must be reached in the first half of the trial (within 7 days)
```

- **Rule 11.183**: Conditions where Reverse Trial is effective

| Condition | Reverse Trial Recommended | Traditional Model Sufficient |
|:----------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
| Value perception speed | Value becomes clearer with deeper usage | Value is clear on first use |
| Workflow integration depth | Deeply integrated into daily operations | Standalone and self-contained |
| Switching costs | Increase after usage begins | Consistently low |
| Product complexity | High (full feature set needed to understand value) | Low (few features) |

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Reverse Trial works for everyone" is false. For products with short Time-to-Value (immediately clear value), traditional Freemium may be more appropriate

### 7.17. Signal-Based PMF Validation

- **Rule 11.184**: In addition to static surveys (Sean Ellis Test, etc.), leverage **real-time behavioral signals** as a complementary PMF determination method

- **Rule 11.185**: Intent Signal classification and utilization

| Signal Category | Specific Signals | PMF Correlation | Application |
|:---------------|:----------------|:----------------|:-----------|
| **Product Signal** | Core feature usage frequency, session depth, inter-feature navigation patterns | Very High | Track as PMF Leading Indicator |
| **Expansion Signal** | Team invitations, new workspace creation, API Key issuance | High | Integration into PQL definition (§7.13) |
| **Market Signal** | Competitor page visit → return to product, frequent pricing page views | Medium-High | Churn prevention, price sensitivity analysis |
| **Intent Signal** | Searches for "XX integration", help center advanced feature browsing | Medium | Upsell/cross-sell opportunity detection |

- **Rule 11.186**: Signal-Based ICP Refinement
  - Augment §4.8 (Dynamic ICP Refinement) with behavioral signals
  - Extract **behavioral patterns from high-PMF cohorts** using machine learning to auto-update ICP definitions
  - Drive evolution from "attribute-based ICP" (industry, company size) to "behavior-based ICP" (users exhibiting specific action patterns)

```
Signal-Based PMF Dashboard (Recommended Structure):
  Tier 1 (Real-time): Core feature DAU, Aha Moment reach rate, PQL conversion rate
  Tier 2 (Weekly): Signal Strength Score, Behavioral Cohort comparison, NRG
  Tier 3 (Monthly): PMF Composite Score, Sean Ellis Test, NRR
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Determining PMF by signals alone" is the trap of data supremacism. Quantitative signals must always be triangulated with qualitative insights (interviews, VoC)

### 7.18. Prosumer PMF Validation Protocol

- **Rule 11.200**: The **Prosumer (Professional × Consumer)** segment sits at the boundary of B2C and B2B, requiring a dedicated validation protocol that neither standard PMF framework can accurately capture

- **Rule 11.201**: Prosumer segment definition and identification criteria

| Attribute | Definition | Examples |
|:----------|:----------|:---------|
| **Persona** | Professionals who adopt products individually, then expand to their organization | Freelance designers, independent consultants, individual DevTool developers |
| **Purchase Pattern** | Start with personal credit card → expense reimbursement → organizational contract expansion | Figma, Notion, GitHub Copilot |
| **Value Judgment** | Evaluated on dual axes of "work efficiency" and "personal satisfaction" | Productivity tools, creative tools |

- **Rule 11.202**: Prosumer PMF unique measurement metrics

| Metric | Definition | PMF Threshold |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| **Personal→Team Expansion Rate** | Rate of expansion from individual use to team/organization | ≥ 15% |
| **Weekend Usage Ratio** | Ratio of weekend to weekday usage (higher = stronger Personal Fit) | ≥ 30% (weekend usage ≥ 30% of weekday) |
| **Self-Serve→Sales Assisted Conversion** | Rate of conversion from self-serve start to sales-assisted organizational contract | ≥ 10% |
| **Tool Evangelism Score** | Frequency of users spontaneously recommending to colleagues/community | NPS ≥ 60 with actual recommendation behavior |
| **Workflow Centrality Index** | Centrality of product in user's daily workflow (1-5) | ≥ 3.5 |

- **Rule 11.203**: Prosumer PMF staged validation process

```
Prosumer PMF Validation Flow:

Phase 1: Individual Fit
  - Individual user reaches Aha Moment and uses product daily
  - Validation: D7 Retention ≥ 60%, TtV ≤ 3 days

Phase 2: Evangelism
  - User spontaneously recommends to colleagues/community
  - Validation: Organic Referral Rate ≥ 20%, Tool Evangelism Score ≥ 60

Phase 3: Team Adoption
  - Expansion from individual → team/department occurs
  - Validation: Personal→Team Expansion Rate ≥ 15%

Phase 4: Enterprise Conversion
  - Team usage → full organizational adoption
  - Validation: Self-Serve→Sales Assisted Conversion ≥ 10%
```

- **Rule 11.204**: Prosumer pricing validation specifics
  - **Individual Tier**: Validate PMF at personally affordable range ($10-$30/month)
  - **Team Tier**: Offer additional value (collaboration, admin features) at 3-5x Individual Tier price
  - **Enterprise Tier**: Meet organizational requirements (security, compliance, SSO)
  - True Prosumer PMF validation is determined by "whether users acquired at Individual Tier naturally migrate to Team Tier"

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Selling at B2B prices to Prosumers" creates adoption barriers. Conversely, "leaving at Consumer prices" misses Enterprise conversion opportunities. Staged price escalation design is essential

---

## Part VIII. Post-PMF Scaling Decisions

### 8.1. PMF → Growth Transition Criteria

- **Rule 11.070**: Expand marketing investment **only when all of the following conditions are met**

```
Required Conditions (AND):
□ PMF Composite Score ≥ 70
□ Sean Ellis Test ≥ 40% (n≥50)
□ D30 Retention exceeds industry standard
□ NPS ≥ 30
□ CAC payback period ≤ 12 months
□ Organic growth accounts for ≥ 20% of all acquisition
□ Unit Economics are viable (LTV/CAC ≥ 3.0)
```

### 8.2. Premature Scaling Prohibition

- **Rule 11.071**: Increasing ad spend, expanding hiring, and shipping many new features without achieving PMF is explicitly prohibited as "Premature Scaling"
- **Evidence**: According to CB Insights analysis, 74% of startup failures are caused by premature scaling before PMF
- **Specific Prohibited Actions During Pre-PMF**:

| Prohibited Action | Permissible Range Before PMF |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------|
| >$7K/month ad investment | Up to $2K/month for LP experiments |
| Hiring 5+ engineers | Founding team + 1-2 people |
| Simultaneous multi-feature development | Focus on 1 core value hypothesis |
| Simultaneous expansion to 2+ countries | Complete PMF in 1 market |
| Building external sales team | Founder-led sales only |
| Mass implementation of 3rd-party integrations | Only 1-2 core-essential integrations |

### 8.3. Pre-Scale Product Health Check

- **Rule 11.072**: Conduct the following product health check before transitioning to scale

| Check Item | Criterion |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Core Feature Activation Rate | ≥ 60% (registered users reaching core feature) |
| Onboarding Completion Rate | ≥ 50% |
| Support Ticket / DAU | ≤ 5% (low support dependency) |
| Page Load Performance | LCP ≤ 2.5s |
| Uptime | ≥ 99.5% (last 30 days) |
| Error Rate | ≤ 1% (critical errors) |
| CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) | ≥ 4.0/5.0 |

### 8.4. Unit Economics Gate (Pre-Scale Economic Verification)

- **Rule 11.073**: Even after declaring PMF, do not proceed to scale unless Unit Economics are viable

| Metric | Minimum Threshold for Scale Permission |
|:-------|:--------------------------------------|
| LTV/CAC | ≥ 3.0 |
| Payback Period | ≤ 12 months |
| Gross Margin | ≥ 60% (SaaS) / ≥ 40% (AI-Native) |
| Monthly Churn | ≤ 5% (B2C) / ≤ 3% (B2B) |
| Burn Multiple | ≤ 2.0 |

- **Rule 11.074**: If Unit Economics fall below criteria, treat as "Revenue PMF Not Achieved" and mandate pricing strategy review (`400_pricing_strategy.md` reference)

---

## Part IX. Competitive Analysis Framework

### 9.1. Competitive Mapping Protocol

- **Rule 11.080**: Map direct and indirect competitors in four quadrants before entry

```
            High Performance / High Price
                 │
    Niche        │   Leaders
    Competitors  │   Competitors
                 │
  ─────────────────────────────
  Narrow Target  │           Broad Target
                 │
    Weak         │    Challengers
    Competitors  │    Competitors
                 │
            Low Performance / Low Price
```

### 9.2. Extended Competitive Classification

- **Rule 11.081**: Analyze competitors across 3 layers

| Layer | Definition | Example |
|:------|:----------|:--------|
| **Direct** | Same problem solved the same way | Notion vs Coda |
| **Indirect** | Same problem solved differently | Notion vs Excel + Email |
| **Alternative** | Non-product solutions customers currently use | Paper notebooks, verbal communication, doing nothing |

### 9.3. Differentiation Principle (10x Better Rule)

- **Rule 11.082**: Define at least one aspect where you are "10x Better" than competitors. "Slightly better (2x)" is insufficient as an entry rationale
- **10x Better Definition**:
  - 10x faster (Uber vs taxi wait time)
  - 1/10 the cost (Airbnb vs hotels)
  - 10x easier access (Canva vs Photoshop)
  - Dramatically superior experience (iPhone vs feature phone)
  - 10x data accuracy (AI analysis vs manual analysis)

### 9.4. Moat Design

- **Rule 11.083**: Consciously design competitive advantage (Moat) from the entry stage

| Moat Type | Description | Build Time | Example |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------|:--------|
| **Network Effects** | Value increases with more users | Long-term | Slack, WhatsApp |
| **Switching Costs** | High cost to switch | Medium-term | Salesforce, SAP |
| **Data Moat** | Unique data accumulation | Medium-long | Google, Netflix |
| **Economies of Scale** | Advantage grows with scale | Long-term | Amazon |
| **Brand** | Brand trust & attachment | Long-term | Apple, Nike |
| **Regulatory Moat** | Entry barriers from regulations/licenses | Variable | Finance, medical devices |
| **AI Moat** | AI advantage from unique model/data | Medium-term | AlphaFold |

- **Rule 11.084**: 2026 reality on AI Moats: Differentiation through AI features alone becomes obsolete rapidly. When including AI in Moat design, always pair it with **unique data accumulation (Data Flywheel)**

### 9.5. Blue Ocean vs Red Ocean Assessment

- **Rule 11.085**: Classify target markets as Blue Ocean (uncontested market) or Red Ocean (existing competitive market) and select strategy

| Criterion | Blue Ocean | Red Ocean |
|:----------|:----------|:---------|
| Number of competitors | 0-2 | 5+ |
| Category establishment | Not established | Established |
| Differentiation axis | Can define new value axes | Competition along existing axes |
| Recommended strategy | Category Creation (§000 reference) | 10x Better + Segment Focus |
| Risk | Market may not exist | Price war / margin compression |

### 9.6. Defensibility in the AI Era

- **Rule 11.187**: In 2026, as AI has commoditized functional capabilities, defensibility stems not from "code" but from "non-functional assets that time reinforces"

| Moat Category | Definition | Build Difficulty | Example |
|:-------------|:----------|:----------------|:--------|
| **Memory as Moat** | Long-term context accumulation where value increases with usage. Impossible to replicate with stateless RAG | High | AI that understands an entire codebase, assistants that learn personal preferences |
| **Learning Velocity** | Speed at which structured signal collection from user interactions → model improvement outpaces competitors | High | Vertical AI that improves accuracy daily with industry-specific data |
| **Reliable Execution** | Deterministic guardrails, audit logs, and escalation protocols create reliability that simple prompt-based wrappers cannot compete with | Medium-High | Mission-critical workflow automation |
| **Proprietary Workflow Data** | Deep, process-level insights into how work is "actually done" | High | "Sweat data" that large enterprises cannot easily replicate |

- **Rule 11.188**: Design the **Data Flywheel → Learning Velocity → Memory Moat circular structure**

```
Data Flywheel Circular Structure:

  User Interaction
       ↓
  Structured Signal Collection (intent, context, outcomes)
       ↓
  Model/Product Improvement (Learning Velocity)
       ↓
  User Experience Enhancement → Aha Moment acceleration
       ↓
  Long-term Context Accumulation (Memory as Moat)
       ↓
  Switching Cost Increase → Retention Strengthening
       ↓
  (Loop: Further User Interaction)
```

- **Rule 11.189**: Defensibility self-assessment check

```
AI-Era Defensibility Scorecard (Quarterly Evaluation):
□ Memory: Is user-specific context being accumulated? (1-5)
□ Learning: Is accuracy/value measurably improving as users increase? (1-5)
□ Reliability: Is the product trusted in mission-critical environments? (1-5)
□ Workflow Data: Do you possess operational data competitors cannot easily obtain? (1-5)

Total ≥ 16: High defensibility
Total 12-15: Moderate (reinforcement needed)
Total < 12: Weak defensibility → Execute §9.4 Moat redesign
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: The illusion that "AI features themselves are a Moat." In 2026 AI, features are replicated within weeks. Moats must be built "outside" the feature (data, trust, workflow integration)

### 9.7. AI-Resistant Value (3-Layer Structure)

- **Rule 11.205**: In 2026, AI has made basic SaaS functionality replicable in days. Sustaining PMF requires building "value that AI cannot replicate" (AI-Resistant Value) across **3 layers**

| Layer | Definition | Build Method | Examples |
|:------|:----------|:------------|:---------|
| **Layer 1: AI-Proof Core** | Value tied to proprietary data, deep industry relationships, or regulatory infrastructure | Accumulate proprietary data, build industry partnerships, obtain regulatory licenses | Bloomberg Terminal (financial data), Epic (medical records) |
| **Layer 2: Integration Moat** | Deep integration into legacy systems, complex internal workflows, or organizational change processes | Deepen enterprise integrations, irreversible embedding into business processes | Workday (HR integration), Palantir (government system integration) |
| **Layer 3: Outcome Guarantee** | Value delivery model that guarantees "outcomes" rather than "capabilities" | Build outcome-based/ROI-guaranteed pricing and contract models | "XX% cost reduction within 90 days" guaranteed SaaS |

- **Rule 11.206**: **Defensibility Stress Test**
  - Conduct the following assessment quarterly to quantitatively evaluate defensibility

```
40% Defensibility Test:

Question: "If a competitor team spent 2 weeks with the latest AI tools,
           what percentage of our delivered value could they realistically rebuild?"

Assessment:
  Replicability ≤ 20%: High defensibility (AI-Resistant Value is robust)
  Replicability 21-40%: Moderate (formulate reinforcement plan)
  Replicability 41-60%: Fragile (Layer 1-3 strengthening mandatory within 6 months)
  Replicability > 60%: Critical (PMF unsustainable. Immediate Moat redesign required)
```

- **Rule 11.207**: AI-Resistant Value construction is managed in integration with **§9.4 Moat Design** and **§9.6 AI-Era Defensibility**. Unified view of the three frameworks:
  - **§9.4**: Traditional 7 Moat types (Network Effects, Switching Costs, etc.)
  - **§9.6**: AI-specific 4 defensibility axes (Memory, Learning Velocity, Reliability, Workflow Data)
  - **§9.7**: AI-Resistant Value 3-layer structure (AI-Proof Core, Integration Moat, Outcome Guarantee)

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Outcome Guarantee is only possible for large enterprises" is false. Even startups can provide Outcome guarantees within limited scope (specific workflow efficiency improvements), and this serves as a powerful PMF signal

---

## Part X. Pivot Decision Protocol

### 10.1. Objective Pivot Criteria

- **Rule 11.090**: Pivots are decided by "data" not "emotion." Consider pivoting if the following triggers are present

| Pivot Trigger | Definition |
|:-------------|:----------|
| **PMF Not Achieved** | PMF Composite Score < 50 after 2+ MVP validations |
| **Retention Collapse** | D30 Retention < 10% (3 consecutive cohorts) |
| **CAC > LTV** | Unit economics not viable for 3 consecutive months |
| **Market Disappearance** | Market eliminated by regulatory/technology changes |
| **Competitive Advantage Loss** | Differentiation nullified by large player entry |
| **Team Motivation Collapse** | Founding team loses conviction in the problem |

### 10.2. Pivot Types

- **Rule 11.091**: When pivoting, clearly define the type

| Pivot Type | Example |
|:----------|:--------|
| **Zoom-in Pivot** | A feature becomes the whole product |
| **Zoom-out Pivot** | Product becomes part of a larger system |
| **Customer Segment Pivot** | Change target customer |
| **Platform Pivot** | App to platform |
| **Business Architecture Pivot** | B2C to B2B2C |
| **Value Capture Pivot** | Change revenue model |
| **Technology Pivot** | Solve the same problem with different tech |
| **Channel Pivot** | Change GTM channel |

### 10.3. Pivot Execution Protocol

- **Rule 11.092**: When executing a pivot, always follow this process
  1. Update the current hypothesis log status to "Refuted"
  2. Clearly define and document the pivot type
  3. Define new Leap of Faith hypotheses after pivot
  4. Design new MVP and success metrics
  5. Assess impact on existing users and create notification plan
  6. Explain and re-commit with the entire team
  7. Create a new Why Now Canvas (§3.4)

### 10.4. Pivot vs Persevere Decision Framework

- **Rule 11.093**: Evaluate on 3 axes when considering a pivot

```
Persevere Conditions:
□ PMF Composite Score is improving quarter-over-quarter
□ PMF signals are emerging in at least one cohort
□ Clear improvement levers have been identified
□ Team retains conviction and learning appetite

Pivot Conditions:
□ Score is flat or declining after 3+ validation cycles
□ There is a fundamental issue of weak customer problem awareness
□ Market timing (§3.4) has changed
□ A more promising adjacent opportunity has been discovered
```

### 10.5. Kill Criteria (Business Exit Criteria)

- **Rule 11.094**: Pre-define criteria for a **complete business exit**, not just a pivot
- **Kill Criteria Standard Template**:

```
Consider business exit if any of the following are met:
□ Remaining runway ≤ 6 months AND PMF Composite Score < 50
□ No PMF signal after 3 pivots
□ 2+ key founding team members have departed
□ Regulatory change makes the business model illegal
□ 90%+ of the market has been monopolized by a large player's entry
```

---

## Part XI. Research & Data Collection Architecture

### 11.1. Mixed Methods (Quantitative × Qualitative) Protocol

- **Rule 11.100**: Market research must always combine Quantitative and Qualitative methods

| Method | Role | Timing | Minimum Sample |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|:--------------|
| **Qualitative Interviews** | Understand "Why?" | Hypothesis building phase | 20 people |
| **Quantitative Surveys** | Measure "How much?" | Hypothesis validation phase | 100 people |
| **Behavioral Data Analysis** | See "What they actually did" | PMF continuous measurement | DAU ≥ 100 |
| **A/B Testing** | Measure "Which is better?" | Optimization phase | Statistical significance achieved |
| **Usability Testing** | See "Can they use it?" | Prototype phase | 5 people |

### 11.2. Market Research Data Quality Management

- **Rule 11.101**: Apply the following quality standards to collected data

| Bias Type | Prevention Strategy |
|:----------|:-------------------|
| **Survivorship Bias** | Collect failure cases, not just successes |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Actively seek data that refutes hypotheses (Devil's Advocate) |
| **Self-Report Bias** | Prioritize behavioral data over stated intent |
| **Sampling Bias** | Exclude non-target users |
| **Social Desirability Bias** | Provide anonymous responses, use behavior-based questions |
| **Novelty Effect** | New feature tests must run for at least 2 weeks |
| **Selection Bias** | Use random or stratified sampling |

### 11.3. Continuous Discovery Process

- **Rule 11.102**: Continue weekly user research even after achieving PMF (Teresa Torres method)
  - Weekly (1+ times) user interviews are a standing team operation
  - Visualize and manage insights using Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

```
OST Structure:
Desired Outcome
  └── Opportunity (User Need)
        ├── Solution A
        │     ├── Experiment 1
        │     └── Experiment 2
        └── Solution B
              └── Experiment 3
```

  - All feature development proposals must be linked to user research
  - **Rule 11.103**: To prevent building "features for nobody," PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) must include a "Supporting Research ID"

---

## Part XII. PMF Maintenance, Decay & Evolution Protocol

### 12.1. PMF Decay Concept

- **Rule 11.110**: **PMF is not a permanent state**. PMF decays due to changes in market environment, competition, and technology
- **2026 Context**: AI enables competitors to replicate features within weeks, making the effective lifespan of PMF historically the shortest it has ever been

### 12.2. PMF Half-Life Definition

- **Rule 11.111**: Use the following industry-specific PMF half-lives as reference for setting PMF re-validation cycles

| Industry | Estimated PMF Half-Life | Primary Decay Driver |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|
| AI-Native SaaS | 3-6 months | Rapid technology obsolescence |
| Consumer Social | 6-12 months | Trend/user preference changes |
| B2B SaaS | 12-18 months | Competitor feature parity |
| FinTech | 12-24 months | Regulatory changes |
| Healthcare | 18-36 months | Regulatory/clinical evidence barriers |

### 12.3. PMF Re-validation Protocol

- **Rule 11.112**: Re-measure PMF Composite Score at the following frequencies

| Phase | Re-validation Frequency | Minimum Sample |
|:------|:-----------------------|:--------------|
| Immediately after PMF achievement (~6 months) | Monthly | 50 |
| Growth stage (6 months-2 years) | Quarterly | 100 |
| Scale stage (2 years+) | Semi-annually | 200 |

### 12.4. PMF Erosion Early Warning System

- **Rule 11.113**: Continuously monitor the following early warning signals. If 3 or more illuminate simultaneously, issue a "PMF Erosion Alert"

| Warning Signal | Threshold |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Sean Ellis Score drops 5%+ from previous | Falls below < 35% |
| D30 Retention declines quarter-over-quarter | Falls below industry standard |
| NPS drops 10+ points quarter-over-quarter | NPS turns negative |
| Organic Growth share declines | Falls below < 15% |
| Negative sentiment in support tickets surges | 30%+ increase month-over-month |
| Switching to competitor cited as reason | 20%+ of churn reasons |
| Core Feature usage rate declines | 15%+ decrease quarter-over-quarter |

### 12.5. PMF Erosion Response Protocol

- **Rule 11.114**: After issuing a PMF Erosion Alert, execute the following steps
  1. **Within 48 hours**: Executive team holds emergency review meeting
  2. **Within 1 week**: Conduct 20 user interviews (focused on "what has changed")
  3. **Within 2 weeks**: Run emergency PMF Engine (§7.4) to identify root cause
  4. **Within 1 month**: Implement improvement measures and measure effectiveness in next PMF survey

### 12.6. Technology Platform Shift Risk

- **Rule 11.115**: PMF depends on the **stability of the underlying platform**. Monitor the following platform shift risks continuously

| Risk Type | Example | Monitoring Method |
|:----------|:--------|:------------------|
| **App Store Policy Changes** | Apple ATT, Google Privacy Sandbox | Review policy changelog quarterly |
| **AI Regulation Changes** | EU AI Act enactment/enforcement | Regulatory trends dashboard (see `security/100_data_governance.md`) |
| **LLM Provider Price Changes** | OpenAI/Anthropic/Google pricing revisions | Monthly Unit Economics impact analysis |
| **Foundation API Deprecation** | Twitter/X API restrictions, Google Maps pricing | Pre-evaluate alternative platforms |
| **Browser Privacy Changes** | 3rd Party Cookie deprecation, ITP | Monitor first-party data strategy progress |

- **Rule 11.116**: If 50%+ of core value depends on a single external platform, issue a **Platform Dependency Risk Alert** and formulate alternative strategies

### 12.7. Compounding Expectation Risk

- **Rule 11.190**: In AI products, user expectations **compound exponentially**. The phenomenon of "today's magic is tomorrow's table stakes" must be systematically managed

```
Compounding Expectation Law:
  User Expectation(t+1) = User Expectation(t) × (1 + Expectation Growth Rate)

  AI-Native SaaS: Expectation Growth Rate ≈ 5-10%/month (80-120% annual compound)
  Traditional SaaS: Expectation Growth Rate ≈ 1-3%/month (12-36% annual compound)
```

- **Rule 11.191**: Compounding Expectation measurement metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Warning Threshold |
|:-------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| **Feature Expectation Gap** | Gap between "expected features" and "current features" (survey) | Gap widens by 10%+ per quarter |
| **Delight Decay Rate** | Speed at which NPS recommendation reasons change (features that were previously "surprising" become "expected") | Major features become "expected" within 6 months |
| **Competitor Parity Speed** | Time for competitors to replicate your key features | Replicated within 3 months |

- **Rule 11.192**: Strategies for addressing compounding expectations

```
3-Layer Response Strategy:
  Layer 1: Innovation Cadence
    - Release "surprise" new features/experiences quarterly
    - Allocate 20%+ of R&D budget to innovation

  Layer 2: Depth Over Breadth
    - Increase workflow integration depth of existing core rather than adding features (horizontal expansion)
    - Continuous improvement of Workflow Completion Rate (§7.14)

  Layer 3: Community-Driven Value
    - User community, ecosystem, marketplace, etc.
    - Escape product-only feature comparison through network effects
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "After PMF achievement, just maintain" is the most dangerous assumption. Especially in AI, PMF half-life may be even shorter than the periods defined in §12.2

### 12.8. PMF Fragility Score

- **Rule 11.208**: Quantitatively measure not just PMF "achievement" but also its "fragility," and take preventive countermeasures

- **Rule 11.209**: PMF Fragility Score calculation

```
PMF Fragility Score (Quarterly Evaluation):

Evaluate the following 5 axes on a 1-5 scale (5 = most fragile) and calculate weighted average:

F1: Feature Replicability
  - "Percentage of features competitors could rebuild within 2 weeks with latest AI tools"
  - 1 (≤20%) → 5 (>80%)

F2: Single Channel Dependency
  - "Customer acquisition dependency rate on top 1 channel"
  - 1 (≤30%) → 5 (>80%)

F3: Key Person Dependency
  - "Risk of PMF collapse if founder/specific person departs"
  - 1 (team distributed) → 5 (completely founder dependent)

F4: Platform Dependency
  - "Core value dependency rate on single external platform"
  - 1 (≤20%) → 5 (>70%)

F5: Market Timing Sensitivity
  - "Risk of PMF invalidation by regulatory changes or technology shifts"
  - 1 (low sensitivity) → 5 (extremely high sensitivity)

Fragility Score = (F1×0.30 + F2×0.15 + F3×0.15 + F4×0.20 + F5×0.20)

Assessment:
  Score ≤ 2.0: Robust PMF (annual monitoring sufficient)
  Score 2.1-3.0: Moderate fragility (formulate quarterly countermeasure plan)
  Score 3.1-4.0: High fragility (execute monthly Moat reinforcement program)
  Score > 4.0: Critical fragility (immediately mobilize all frameworks from §9.4-§9.7)
```

- **Rule 11.210**: If Fragility Score exceeds 3.0, classify as "**Fragile PMF**" regardless of PMF Composite Score value, and execute fragility reduction measures in parallel with §12.5 response protocol

- **Anti-Pattern**: "PMF Composite Score is high so we're fine" overlooks the Fragility dimension. PMF should be evaluated on 2 dimensions: "strength" and "fragility"

---

## Part XIII. PMF Expansion (Adjacent Market Expansion)

### 13.1. Adjacent Market Entry Prerequisites

- **Rule 11.120**: Expansion to adjacent markets is permitted **only when core market PMF is stable**

```
Expansion Permission Prerequisites (AND):
□ Core market PMF Composite Score ≥ 75 (stability zone)
□ D30 Retention stable or improving for 3 consecutive quarters
□ Core market Unit Economics stable (LTV/CAC ≥ 3.0)
□ Can allocate resources to expansion without impacting core team
```

### 13.2. Adjacent Market PMF Expansion Framework

- **Rule 11.121**: PMF expansion to adjacent markets follows these phases

```
Phase 1: Adjacency Assessment
  Market Adjacency = (Shared Problems × Shared Tech Stack × Shared Channels) / Unique Requirements
  Adjacency ≥ 0.7: Low-risk expansion (tech/channel shareable)
  Adjacency 0.4-0.6: Medium-risk expansion (partial customization needed)
  Adjacency < 0.4: High-risk expansion (closer to new venture)

Phase 2: Minimum Validation (Adjacent-market MVP)
  Adapt core product and validate hypotheses for the adjacent market
  Conduct minimum 10 interviews in the adjacent market

Phase 3: Achieve Segment PMF
  Target PMF Composite Score ≥ 60 in the adjacent market

Phase 4: Multi-Segment PMF Management
  Manage PMF scores for both core and adjacent markets in parallel
  Monitor whether improvements in one are degrading the other
```

### 13.3. PMF Dilution Risk Management

- **Rule 11.122**: Manage the risk that adjacent market entry dilutes core market PMF
- **Dilution Alert**: If core market PMF Composite Score drops 5+ points from pre-expansion baseline, pause expansion
- **Anti-Pattern**: "Escaping to adjacent market because we can't win in core market" pattern is prohibited. Escape-driven expansion leads to dual PMF failure

### 13.4. Geographic PMF Expansion Protocol

- **Rule 11.123**: In **international expansion** of the same product, domestic PMF success does not guarantee overseas success. **Region-specific PMF re-validation** is mandatory

- **Rule 11.124**: Localization PMF checklist before geographic expansion

```
Localization PMF Validation Items (AND conditions):
□ Completed 10+ interviews in local language
□ Pain Severity Score equal to or above home market (Gap ≤ 2pt)
□ Compliance with local regulations/laws confirmed (see §3.6)
□ "Why this country now" Why Now Canvas completed
□ Local competitive landscape mapped
□ Local partner or Country Manager secured
```

- **Rule 11.125**: Regional PMF success is judged using the same PMF Composite Score as the home market, but NPS thresholds are adjusted regionally to account for cultural response bias when validated by local research.
- **Anti-Pattern**: "It succeeded in one language market, so translation alone will work in another region" ignores the cultural dimension of PMF.

### 13.5. Second Product PMF Protocol

- **Rule 11.126**: PMF validation for a **new product** distinct from the existing product follows a different protocol from adjacent market expansion (§13.1-13.3)

```
Second Product PMF Prerequisites (AND):
□ First product PMF Composite Score ≥ 80 (stable phase)
□ First product growth is autonomous (no daily founder intervention needed)
□ Dedicated second product team (minimum 2 members) secured
□ Second product's own Founder-Market Fit (§1.5) evaluated
```

- **Rule 11.127**: The second product **validates PMF completely independently** from the first product. Do not conflate the first product's customer base with "guaranteed PMF"
  - Cross-selling to first product's existing customers is leveraged as a "favorable channel" but distinguished from "Organic" in PMF determination
  - PMF Composite Score is not combined with the first product's score

- **Rule 11.128**: **Cross-Product Cannibalization Monitoring**: If the first product's PMF Composite Score drops 5+ points after second product launch, cannibalization may be occurring. Consider repositioning redesign

---

## Part XIV. Demand-Side Validation & Pre-Revenue Proof

### 14.1. Pre-Revenue Proof Hierarchy

- **Rule 11.130**: Leverage the following means in reliability order to prove demand before product development

| Method | Reliability | Preparation Time | Legal Considerations |
|:-------|:-----------|:----------------|:--------------------|
| **Signed LOI** | ★★★★★ | 2-4 weeks | Specify scope of legal binding |
| **Pre-order (Prepaid)** | ★★★★★ | 2-4 weeks | Refund policy must be explicit |
| **Paid Waitlist** | ★★★★ | 1-2 weeks | Sell as "future access rights" |
| **Design Partner Contract** | ★★★★ | 4-8 weeks | Document co-development rights/obligations |
| **Free Waitlist** | ★★ | 1 week | Weak as evidence |
| **"Likes" / Follower count** | ★ | — | Prohibited for decision-making |

### 14.2. LOI (Letter of Intent) Protocol

- **Rule 11.131**: In B2B businesses, LOIs are the strongest pre-revenue validation. Collect using the following protocol

```yaml
loi_protocol:
  target: "Decision-makers (VP+) at ICP-matching companies"
  minimum_count: 5  # Prerequisite for PMF declaration
  content_must_include:
    - "Specific problem description"
    - "Anticipated use scenario"
    - "Estimated budget range"
    - "Implementation requirements (features/timeline)"
    - "Signatory name and title"
  validity_period: "90 days"
  non_binding: true  # Explicitly state non-binding
```

### 14.3. Waitlist Quality Metrics

- **Rule 11.132**: Evaluate waitlist "quality," not just "quantity"

| Metric | Healthy Level | Warning Level |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|
| ICP match rate | ≥ 60% | < 30% |
| Email open rate | ≥ 50% | < 20% |
| Update email reply rate | ≥ 10% | < 3% |
| Paid waitlist conversion rate | ≥ 5% | < 1% |
| Drop-off rate (within 30 days) | ≤ 20% | > 50% |

### 14.4. Design Partner → Paying Customer Conversion Process

- **Rule 11.133**: Define the standard process for converting Design Partners (`000_product_strategy.md` §2.5 reference) to paying customers

```
Step 1: Value Demonstration (2-4 weeks)
  Design Partner experiences "Aha Moment" and continuously uses core features

Step 2: Paid Conversion Discussion (Week 4-6)
  Offer "50% discount Early Adopter pricing" from regular pricing
  Set early-price validity period (e.g., 12 months)

Step 3: Contract & Transition (Week 6-8)
  Sign paid contract and document SLA/support structure
  Execute free-to-paid transition

Conversion Success Criteria: 3 out of 5 Design Partners convert to paid
```

---

## Part XV. AI-Native Market Validation Protocol

### 15.1. AI-Augmented Validation

- **Rule 11.140**: Leverage AI-native validation tools to accelerate validation cycle speed

| AI Use Case | Example Tools | Effect | Constraints |
|:-----------|:-------------|:------|:-----------|
| **Interview Transcription** | Whisper / Otter.ai | Analysis speed improvement | PII handling caution |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | GPT / Claude API | Analysis of large feedback volumes | Contextual understanding limits |
| **Synthetic Persona Research** | Synthetic Users API | High-speed hypothesis pressure testing | Cannot replace actual users |
| **Competitive Analysis Automation** | Web Scraping + LLM | Real-time competitor tracking | Legal risks of scraping |
| **Market Size Estimation** | LLM + Database integration | Bottom-up calculation assistance | Estimates must be human-verified |

### 15.2. Synthetic User Research

- **Rule 11.141**: Permit AI-generated Synthetic Personas for **initial pressure testing** of hypotheses. The following constraints must be strictly observed

```
Synthetic Research Permitted Scope:
✅ "Pre-check" hypothesis direction (preparation before real research)
✅ Initial screening for messaging "A/B testing"
✅ "Pattern expansion" based on existing interview data
✅ Insight extraction from large volumes of competitor reviews

❌ Prohibited:
✗ Decision-making based solely on Synthetic Research
✗ Recording Synthetic Research results as "user interviews"
✗ Proving market existence for new categories (real user validation mandatory)
✗ Price sensitivity research (cannot replace actual WTP validation)
```

- **Rule 11.142**: Synthetic Research results must always be labeled "Synthetic" and never mixed with Real Research

### 15.3. AI-Native PMF Unique Challenges

- **Rule 11.143**: Apply the following additional protocols for PMF validation of products with AI as core value

| AI-Native Unique Challenge | Countermeasure |
|:--------------------------|:-------------|
| **AI Commoditization** | Judge PMF by the **uniqueness of AI outputs**, not AI functionality itself |
| **Novelty Effect** | Do not finalize PMF measurement for **2 months** after AI feature release |
| **Hallucination Risk** | Include user Trust Score in PMF metrics |
| **Prompt Sensitivity** | Experience varies by user input quality. Measure TtV (Time to Value) variance |
| **Model Version Dependency** | Risk of PMF fluctuating with LLM version updates. Measure PMF with fixed model version |
| **Cost Unpredictability** | AI inference costs may destroy Unit Economics. Monitor Gross Margin in parallel |
| **Agentic AI PMF** | AI Agent product PMF is measured by Task Completion Rate, Autonomy Level, and Human Override Rate. Traditional DAU/MAU is insufficient |
| **Multi-Modal Experience Drift** | Risk of uneven UX quality across multi-modal inputs (voice, image, text). Measure TtV per modality |

- **Rule 11.172**: **Agentic AI PMF Detailed Metrics**: A dedicated metrics framework for precisely measuring PMF of AI Agent products

| Metric | Definition | PMF Threshold |
|:------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Goal Attainment Rate** | Percentage of tasks the agent completed without human intervention | ≥ 80% |
| **Cost per Successful Outcome** | AI inference cost per successful outcome | < 10% of value delivered |
| **Autonomy Ratio** | Percentage of tasks processed autonomously by the agent | ≥ 70% |
| **Escalation Rate** | Rate of escalation to humans | ≤ 15% |
| **Context Chain Health** | Percentage of multi-step workflows completed without losing context | ≥ 85% |
| **Recovery Rate** | Percentage of autonomous recovery from errors | ≥ 60% |

- **Anti-Pattern**: "AI Wrapper Trap" — Products that are thin wrappers around LLM APIs without proprietary data/workflow integration immediately lose competitive advantage when model providers move downstream. Always co-build a **Data Flywheel** (§9.4)

### 15.4. Proof of Value (PoV) vs Proof of Concept (PoC)

- **Rule 11.144**: For AI-Native products, validate by **business metric impact** (PoV), not just technical operation verification (PoC)

```
PoC (Technical Verification): "Does this technology work?"
  → Necessary but insufficient for market validation

PoV (Value Proof): "Does this technology improve specific business metrics?"
  → Usable for PMF determination

PoV Design Template:
  subject: "Target customer segment"
  before_metric: "Pre-implementation metric value"
  after_metric: "Post-implementation target metric value"
  measurement_period: "4-8 weeks"
  success_criteria: "Metric improves by XX%"
```

### 15.5. AI Safety & Trust as PMF Dimension

- **Rule 11.145**: In AI-Native products, **Safety and Trust are independent components of PMF**, measured separately from functional PMF

| Trust Metric | Definition | PMF Threshold |
|:------------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Trust Score** | Percentage of users responding "I trust the AI's output" | ≥ 70% |
| **Safety Incident Rate** | Rate of safety incidents caused by AI output | < 0.01% |
| **Human Override Rate** | Percentage of users manually overriding AI suggestions | ≤ 20% (lower = higher trust) |
| **Explainability Satisfaction** | User satisfaction with AI decision explanations | ≥ 65% |
| **Bias Detection Coverage** | Coverage of bias detection tests | ≥ 90% |

- **Rule 11.146**: If Trust Score falls below 50%, treat as **PMF not achieved** regardless of PMF Composite Score. Sustainable PMF cannot exist for an AI that users do not trust
- **Cross-Reference**: `ai/000_ai_engineering` (AI Safety Scorecard), `security/100_data_governance` (Data Governance)

### 15.6. Deep Tech & Hardware PMF Protocol

- **Rule 11.176**: Deep Tech (biotech, materials, robotics) and hardware product PMF requires fundamentally different long-term validation cycles compared to software products

- **Rule 11.177**: **Technology Readiness Level (TRL) × PMF Phase Alignment**

| TRL | Definition | PMF Phase | Validation Activity |
|:----|:----------|:----------|:-------------------|
| **TRL 1-3** | Basic research / proof of concept | Pre-PMF (problem validation) | Customer interviews, LOI collection |
| **TRL 4-6** | Lab demonstration / pilot | PMF exploration (PoV validation) | Design Partner, pilot programs |
| **TRL 7-8** | System demonstration / pre-production | PMF confirmation (commercial validation) | Limited commercialization, price validation |
| **TRL 9** | Mass production / commercial deployment | PMF achieved | PMF Composite Score measurement |

- **Rule 11.178**: Deep Tech PMF unique metrics

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|:------|:-----------|:----------|
| **Technical Risk Resolution** | Resolution rate of key technical risks | ≥ 80% |
| **Pilot→Commercial Conversion Rate** | Conversion from pilot customers to paid contracts | ≥ 50% |
| **Time to Deployment** | Duration from deployment start to operational launch | ≤ 50% of industry standard |
| **Unit Economics at Scale** | Projected unit economics at mass production | Gross Margin ≥ 40% |
| **IP Portfolio Strength** | Patent filing/acquisition status | Core technology patent protection |

- **Rule 11.179**: Include **Climate Tech-specific impact metrics** in PMF evaluation

| Metric | Definition | Relationship to PMF |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------------|
| **Carbon Reduction per $** | CO2 reduction per dollar invested | Complementary to unit economics |
| **SDG Alignment Score** | Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals | Investor/regulator evaluation |
| **Scalability Factor** | Technology scalability (cost structure at 10x deployment) | PMF → Scale transition criterion |

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Tech-Push Trap" — Being captivated by technological innovation and retrofitting market problems. Even in Deep Tech, "Problem First" (§2.1 JTBD) is an immutable principle

### 15.7. Outcome-Based PMF & Pricing Validation

- **Rule 11.193**: In the AI era, PMF is measured by "**Workflow Replacement**" not "**Feature Enhancement**"

- **Rule 11.194**: Measure the **Workflow Replacement Index (WRI)**

```
Workflow Replacement Index (WRI):

WRI = (Manual Effort Hours Saved × Hourly Cost) / Monthly Product Cost

WRI ≥ 10: Overwhelming ROI (customers pay immediately)
WRI 5-9: Strong ROI (payback is clear)
WRI 2-4: Moderate ROI (competitive comparison occurs)
WRI < 2: Insufficient ROI (pricing redesign needed)
```

- **Rule 11.195**: **Outcome-Based Pricing Validation Protocol**: Align value delivery with revenue in response to AI inference cost variability

| Pricing Model | Definition | PMF Validation Method | Fit Conditions |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|:--------------|
| **Per-Outcome** | Charge per successful outcome (e.g., cost per resolved ticket) | Measure WTP and cost per outcome | Outcomes are clearly quantifiable |
| **Hybrid (Base + Outcome)** | Platform base fee + outcome-linked fee | Validate base fee PMF + outcome fee scalability separately | Both base value and variable value exist |
| **Usage-Based** | Consumption-based billing by volume | Validate correlation between usage and Value Delivered | API/transaction-type products |

- **Rule 11.196**: Outcome-Based PMF success criteria

```
Outcome-Based PMF Criteria (AND):
□ WRI ≥ 5 (customer experiences 5x+ value relative to cost)
□ Customer ROI demonstration period ≤ 30 days (value proven within 1 month)
□ Outcome achievement rate ≥ 85% (deliver promised outcomes 85%+)
□ Unit Economics viable: AI inference cost per outcome < 40% of charge per outcome
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "Selling AI products with per-seat pricing" creates a disconnect between revenue and impact. When AI Agents replace human work, seat-based models constrain your own value capture

### 15.8. Multi-Agent & Tool-Use PMF

- **Rule 11.197**: Products with **Multi-Agent Orchestration** must measure orchestration quality in addition to single-Agent metrics

| Metric | Definition | PMF Threshold |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| **Tool-Use Success Rate** | Rate at which Agent correctly invokes tools (API/DB/external services) and obtains expected results | ≥ 90% |
| **Orchestration Completion Rate** | Rate at which multi-step workflows complete all stages | ≥ 80% |
| **Inter-Agent Handoff Fidelity** | Accuracy of context handoff between Agents | ≥ 95% |
| **Error Recovery without Human** | Rate at which Agents autonomously recover from errors | ≥ 70% |
| **End-to-End Latency** | Total workflow completion time | Within user tolerance threshold |

- **Rule 11.198**: **MCP/A2A Protocol Compliance PMF**
  - When AI agents interact with external tools and other Agents via standard protocols (MCP: Model Context Protocol, A2A: Agent-to-Agent), include **protocol compliance level** in PMF metrics
  - **Integration Depth Score**: Number of supported protocols × feature coverage rate per protocol

- **Rule 11.199**: Multi-Agent PMF unique risks

```
Multi-Agent PMF Risk Management:
□ Cascade failure risk: Can one Agent's failure halt the entire workflow?
□ Cost explosion risk: Is token consumption between Agents growing exponentially?
□ Responsibility boundary ambiguity: Is it clear which Agent is responsible for errors?
□ Version compatibility: Can individual Agent updates break overall orchestration?
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "More Agents is better" is false. Unnecessary inter-Agent communication increases latency, cost, and error rates. Prioritize designs that **achieve maximum outcomes with minimum Agents**

### 15.9. Zero-Click Discovery & Validation Economy Protocol

- **Rule 11.211**: In 2026, user discovery behavior has shifted from the traditional "search → click → visit" to **"AI search → zero-click answer."** Market validation must account for this new discovery pathway

- **Rule 11.212**: **Validation Economy — 3 Channels**

| Channel | Definition | Validation Method | Relationship to PMF |
|:--------|:----------|:-----------------|:-------------------|
| **AI Search Visibility** | Product exposure through LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) recommendations and citations | GEO (Generative Engine Optimization): Measure frequency of LLMs citing your product in responses | New component of organic discovery pathway |
| **Expert Validation** | Credibility endorsement from industry experts and influencers | Track domain expert reviews and recommendation count | PMF complementary metric as a trust signal |
| **Community-Generated Content** | User-generated content on Reddit, YouTube, newsletters, etc. | Track UGC count and sentiment mentioning your product | New measurement source for Organic Pull (§8.1) |

- **Rule 11.213**: **LLMs.txt Compliance Protocol**
  - Place an `llms.txt` file on your product site to enable LLMs to accurately cite product information
  - Provide the following information in structured format:
    - Product official name, description, and key features
    - Target user segments and problems solved
    - Pricing information and comparison points
  - **Measurement**: Track citation frequency in AI search engines monthly and integrate with Organic Growth metrics (§8.1)

- **Rule 11.214**: Impact of Zero-Click era on PMF validation

```
Zero-Click Discovery PMF Adjustment:

Traditional Organic Growth Measurement:
  Organic Rate = Organic Signups / Total Signups

2026 Organic Growth Measurement (Extended):
  Extended Organic Rate = (Direct + Organic Search + AI Search Referral + UGC Referral) / Total Signups

AI Search Referral Measurement:
  - UTM parameter tracking (utm_source=chatgpt, perplexity, etc.)
  - Referrer header analysis
  - First-visit survey ("How did you hear about us?" with AI search option added)
```

- **Anti-Pattern**: "SEO alone is enough for organic" is insufficient in the zero-click era. Ensure discoverability through **both** GEO (AI search optimization) and SEO

---

## Part XVI. Market Validation Maturity Model (5 Levels)

- **Rule 11.150**: Evaluate organizational market validation process maturity across 5 levels and maintain an improvement plan for advancing to the next level

| Level | Name | Characteristics | Key Practices | Readiness Criteria |
|:------|:-----|:---------------|:-------------|:------------------|
| **L1** | **Intuition** | Judgment by founder intuition and experience. No systematic validation | None | — |
| **L2** | **Ad-hoc** | Customer interviews and research conducted ad-hoc | Mom Test, irregular interviews | L1→L2: 10+ interviews conducted |
| **L3** | **Structured** | Hypothesis logs, Pain Scores, Evidence Hierarchy utilized | Hypothesis log, RAT, MVP design, Sean Ellis | L2→L3: Hypothesis log operational |
| **L4** | **Data-Driven** | Composite Score, cohort analysis, continuous discovery | PMF Engine, Cohort PMF, OST | L3→L4: PMF Composite Score operational |
| **L5** | **Predictive** | AI-Augmented Discovery, PMF Decay prediction, Synthetic Research | AI analysis, Predictive Churn, Market Sensing | L4→L5: AI validation pipeline operational |

- **Anti-Pattern**: Attempting to skip from L1 to L5 is prohibited. Each level's foundation is a prerequisite for the next

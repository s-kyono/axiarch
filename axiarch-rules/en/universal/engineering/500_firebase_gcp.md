## §0. Primary Directives

### Primary Directive 0.1: Auxiliary Engine Principle
-   **Law**: Firebase is an "Auxiliary Engine"; **data sovereignty belongs to Supabase (PostgreSQL)**. New data storage in Firestore is prohibited in principle.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Data Sovereignty**: All user and domain data must be stored in Supabase. Firestore is permitted only for legacy maintenance.
    2.  **Peripheral Services Only**: Firebase usage is limited to FCM, Analytics, Crashlytics, App Check, Remote Config, Performance Monitoring, etc.
    3.  **No New Firestore Collections**: Creating new collections is prohibited. Only maintenance of existing collections is permitted.

### Primary Directive 0.2: Defense in Depth
-   **Law**: Security must not depend on a single layer. Multi-layered defense with App Check + Security Rules + IAM + VPC is mandatory.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **App Check Mandatory**: Enable App Check on all Firebase services and custom backends.
    2.  **Least Privilege**: All service accounts and IAM roles must follow the principle of least privilege. `roles/owner` in production is prohibited.
    3.  **Zero Trust Network**: Minimize trust boundaries using VPC Service Controls and Private Google Access.

### Primary Directive 0.3: Idempotency First
-   **Law**: All Cloud Run Functions and Cloud Run Services must be designed to be idempotent.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Event ID Deduplication**: Event-triggered functions must implement deduplication using `eventId`.
    2.  **Transactional Writes**: Use transactions or batch writes for Firestore writes.
    3.  **Retry Safety**: Guarantee that retries do not cause duplicate side effects.

### Primary Directive 0.4: FinOps Guardian
-   **Law**: Cloud costs are managed with the same rigor as technical debt. Budget overruns are treated as incidents.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Budget Alerts**: Set budget alerts at 50%/80%/100%/120% for all projects.
    2.  **Automated Response**: Automatically stop non-critical resources when exceeding 100% via Cloud Run Functions.
    3.  **Cost Tagging**: Apply `environment`/`service`/`owner` labels to all GCP resources.

### Primary Directive 0.5: Cloud Run Unified
-   **Law**: Since 2025, Cloud Functions (2nd Gen) has been renamed to **Cloud Run Functions**. All serverless compute is managed uniformly as the Cloud Run family.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Naming**: Use "Cloud Run Functions" in documentation, code, and IaC.
    2.  **Unified Management**: Monitor and manage Cloud Run Functions, Services, and Jobs uniformly.
    3.  **Migration Path**: Migrate 1st Gen Functions to Cloud Run Functions promptly.

## §1. Firebase Project Strategy & GCP Integration

### Rule 32.1: Project Separation Strategy
-   **Mandate**: Separate Firebase/GCP projects per environment.
-   **Structure**:
    ```
    myapp-dev      → Development (free testing)
    myapp-staging  → Staging (production-equivalent config)
    myapp-prod     → Production (strict IAM controls)
    ```

### Rule 32.2: GCP Project Configuration
-   **Mandate**: Firebase projects are always built on top of GCP projects.
-   **Configuration**:
    -   **Organization**: Set up folder structure under GCP Organization and apply policies hierarchically.
    -   **Billing Account**: Set budgets per environment, separating production and development billing.
    -   **API Enablement**: Explicitly enable required APIs (`firebase.googleapis.com`, `run.googleapis.com`, `artifactregistry.googleapis.com`, etc.).

### Rule 32.3: Region Selection
-   **Mandate**: Maintain region consistency across services. Deploy Cloud Run Functions, Cloud Run, and Firestore in the same region.
-   **Recommended**: `us-central1` (Iowa) or `europe-west1` (Belgium) as default for global-facing services.
-   **Caution**: Firestore region cannot be changed after creation. Configure initial setup carefully.
-   **GPU Availability**: Cloud Run GPU (NVIDIA L4 GA / RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Preview) is available only in specific regions (`us-central1`, `europe-west1`, `europe-west4`, `asia-southeast1`, `asia-south1`, etc.). Consider this when selecting regions for AI inference workloads.

### Rule 32.4: Blaze Plan Mandatory
-   **Mandate**: As of February 3, 2026, Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go) is required for all Firebase projects. Spark plan no longer supports key features like Cloud Storage.
-   **Action**: Migrate all projects to Blaze plan and always set budget alerts (see §26).

---

## §2. Cloud Run Functions (formerly Cloud Functions 2nd Gen)

### Rule 32.5: Cloud Run Functions Standardization
-   **Mandate**: All new serverless functions must use **Cloud Run Functions**. Creating new 1st Gen functions is prohibited.
-   **Advantage**:
    -   High performance via Cloud Run infrastructure (up to 32GB RAM, 8 vCPU)
    -   Concurrency support (default 80, max 1000)
    -   125+ event sources via Eventarc
    -   Traffic splitting and revision rollback
    -   HTTP functions can run up to 1 hour
-   **Supported Runtimes (as of March 2026)**: Node.js 22/24, Go 1.23/1.24/1.26, Python 3.12/3.13/3.14, Java 21/25, Ruby 3.3/4.0, PHP 8.4/8.5, .NET 8/10.

### Rule 32.6: Cold Start Mitigation
-   **Mandate**: Implement cold start mitigation for latency-sensitive functions.
-   **Strategies**:
    1.  **Min Instances**: Set `minInstances: 1` or higher for critical functions (login, payment).
    2.  **Concurrency**: Process multiple requests per instance using concurrency.
    3.  **Global Variable Reuse**: Initialize DB connections and HTTP clients at global scope for reuse across invocations.
    4.  **Lightweight Initialization**: Use lazy loading for heavy initialization.
    5.  **Cloud Scheduler Warmup**: Send periodic pings to low-frequency functions.

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Reuse DB connection via global variable
import { initializeApp } from "firebase-admin/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase-admin/firestore";

const app = initializeApp();
const db = getFirestore(app);

export const myFunction = onRequest(
  { minInstances: 1, concurrency: 80, memory: "512MiB" },
  async (req, res) => {
    const doc = await db.collection("config").doc("main").get();
    res.json(doc.data());
  }
);
```

### Rule 32.7: Runtime Configuration
-   **Mandate**: Explicitly set resource limits and timeouts for all functions. Do not rely on defaults.
-   **Configuration**:
    ```typescript
    export const processOrder = onRequest({
      region: "asia-northeast1",
      memory: "512MiB",
      timeoutSeconds: 120,
      minInstances: 1,
      maxInstances: 100,
      concurrency: 80,
      cpu: 1,
    }, handler);
    ```
-   **Guidelines**:
    | Use Case | Memory | Timeout | Min Instances | Concurrency |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | API Endpoint | 256-512MiB | 60s | 1 | 80 |
    | Image Processing | 1-2GiB | 300s | 0 | 10 |
    | Batch Processing | 2-4GiB | 540s | 0 | 1 |
    | Webhook Receiver | 256MiB | 30s | 0 | 80 |
    | AI Inference (CPU) | 4-8GiB | 300s | 0 | 4 |
    | Genkit AI Flow | 1-2GiB | 120s | 0-1 | 20 |

### Rule 32.8: Function Organization
-   **Mandate**: Split functions by feature module and leverage Codebases.
-   **Structure**:
    ```
    functions/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── api/          # HTTP API functions
    │   ├── triggers/     # Firestore triggers
    │   ├── scheduled/    # Scheduled functions
    │   ├── pubsub/       # Pub/Sub triggers
    │   ├── tasks/        # Cloud Tasks handlers
    │   ├── genkit/       # Genkit AI flows
    │   └── shared/       # Common utilities
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json
    ```
-   **Deployment**: Split into groups of 10 or fewer when deploying many functions.

### Rule 32.9: Idempotency Implementation
-   **Mandate**: All event-triggered functions must be designed idempotently.
-   **Pattern**:
    ```typescript
    export const onOrderCreated = onDocumentCreated(
      "orders/{orderId}",
      async (event) => {
        const eventId = event.id;
        
        // Deduplication: Skip already-processed events
        const processedRef = db.collection("processedEvents").doc(eventId);
        const processed = await processedRef.get();
        if (processed.exists) {
          console.log(`Event ${eventId} already processed. Skipping.`);
          return;
        }
        
        await processOrder(event.data);
        await processedRef.set({ processedAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp() });
      }
    );
    ```

### Rule 32.10: 1st Gen → Cloud Run Functions Migration
-   **Mandate**: Migrate 1st Gen Functions to Cloud Run Functions promptly.
-   **Migration Tool**: Use the GCP-provided upgrade tool (Preview).
-   **Breaking Changes**: Note trigger syntax changes due to Eventarc integration.

### Rule 32.11: onCallGenkit Trigger
-   **Mandate**: Use `onCallGenkit` trigger when deploying Genkit AI flows as Callable Functions.
-   **Benefit**: Automatic Firebase App Check integration, Firebase Auth verification, type-safe request/response.
    ```typescript
    import { onCallGenkit } from "firebase-functions/https";
    import { genkit } from "genkit";
    
    const ai = genkit({ plugins: [googleAI()] });
    
    const summarizeFlow = ai.defineFlow("summarize", async (input: string) => {
      const { text } = await ai.generate({ prompt: `Summarize: ${input}` });
      return text;
    });
    
    export const summarize = onCallGenkit(
      { enforceAppCheck: true },
      summarizeFlow
    );
    ```

## §3. Cloud Run Services & Jobs

### Rule 32.12: Cloud Run Functions vs Cloud Run Services Decision Matrix
-   **Mandate**: Choose appropriately based on processing requirements.
-   **Decision Matrix**:
    | Requirement | Cloud Run Functions | Cloud Run Services |
    |---|---|---|
    | Firebase Event Triggers | ✅ Optimal | ❌ Not suited |
    | Lightweight Webhooks | ✅ Optimal | ○ Possible |
    | Complex API (Multi-route) | △ Limited | ✅ Optimal |
    | Docker/Custom Runtime | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Optimal |
    | Batch Processing (Long) | △ Max 1h | ✅ Max 24h |
    | WebSocket/gRPC/SSE | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Optimal |
    | GPU (AI Inference) | ❌ Not possible | ✅ L4 GPU GA |
    | Genkit AI Flows | ✅ onCallGenkit | ✅ HTTP Server |

### Rule 32.13: Cloud Run Services Design
-   **Mandate**: Cloud Run Services must be stateless and containerized.
-   **Best Practices**:
    1.  **Stateless**: Do not share state between instances. Store state in Firestore/Cloud SQL/Redis.
    2.  **Fast Startup**: Minimize container startup time (target: under 2s, GPU: under 5s).
    3.  **Health Check**: Implement `/health` endpoint and enable Startup/Liveness probes.
    4.  **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle SIGTERM appropriately (complete cleanup within 10s).

### Rule 32.14: Cloud Run GPU Support (GA)
-   **Mandate**: Use Cloud Run GPU (NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GA / RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Preview) for AI inference and ML processing.
-   **Features**:
    -   Per-second billing, scale-to-zero support
    -   Approximately 5-second startup (pre-installed drivers)
    -   Cloud Run SLA applies
-   **Use Cases**: LLM inference, image generation, video transcoding, batch AI processing
-   **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    # Cloud Run Service with GPU
    metadata:
      annotations:
        run.googleapis.com/gpu-type: nvidia-l4
    spec:
      containers:
        - resources:
            limits:
              nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
              memory: "16Gi"
              cpu: "4"
    ```
-   **Available Regions**: `us-central1`, `europe-west1`, `europe-west4`, `asia-southeast1`, `asia-south1`.

### Rule 32.15: Cloud Run Jobs
-   **Mandate**: Use Cloud Run Jobs for run-to-completion batch processing.
-   **Use Cases**: Data export, report generation, bulk email, data migration, batch AI inference.
-   **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    taskCount: 10        # Parallel tasks
    maxRetries: 3        # Retry count
    timeout: 3600s       # Timeout (max 24h)
    ```

---

## §4. Event-Driven Design (Eventarc / Pub/Sub / Cloud Tasks)

### Rule 32.16: Asynchronous Processing Principle
-   **Mandate**: Offload heavy processing to asynchronous execution to minimize user wait time.
-   **Anti-Pattern**: Synchronously executing external API calls, email sending, or image processing within Cloud Run Functions.

### Rule 32.17: Pub/Sub Design Patterns
-   **Mandate**: Use Pub/Sub for loosely coupled inter-service communication.
-   **Best Practices**:
    1.  **Push vs Pull**: Push delivery for serverless, Pull delivery for always-on services.
    2.  **Exactly-Once Delivery**: Available with Pull subscriptions. Use Ordering Keys when message order matters.
    3.  **Filtering**: Reduce unnecessary message processing with subscription-level filtering.
    4.  **Batch Publishing**: Enable batching on the publisher side.
    5.  **Flow Control**: Configure on both publisher and subscriber sides.
    6.  **Dead Letter Topic**: Always configure a destination for messages exceeding retry limits.
    7.  **Message Size**: Max 10MB. Use Cloud Storage reference passing for larger payloads.

### Rule 32.18: Cloud Tasks
-   **Mandate**: Use Cloud Tasks for asynchronous tasks requiring rate control.
-   **Best Practices**:
    1.  **Concurrency Control**: Control concurrent execution to downstream services.
    2.  **Exponential Backoff**: Always configure exponential backoff with jitter.
    3.  **IAM Security**: Apply IAM policies for task creation and consumption.
    4.  **Scheduled Execution**: Configure tasks for execution at specific future times.
    5.  **Deduplication**: Include unique IDs in task names for idempotency.

### Rule 32.19: Eventarc
-   **Mandate**: Use Eventarc for event-driven processing from GCP services.
-   **Supported Sources**: Cloud Audit Logs, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Firebase Authentication, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, and 125+ event sources.
-   **Advanced Channel**: Use Eventarc Advanced channels for publishing custom events.

### Rule 32.20: Cloud Scheduler
-   **Mandate**: Use Cloud Scheduler for periodic tasks.
-   **Integration Pattern**:
    ```
    Cloud Scheduler → Pub/Sub Topic → Cloud Run Functions/Services
    Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Tasks Queue → Cloud Run
    Cloud Scheduler → HTTP Endpoint → Cloud Run Functions (warmup)
    ```

### Rule 32.21: Cloud Workflows
-   **Mandate**: Use Cloud Workflows to orchestrate multiple GCP services with sequence control.
-   **Use Cases**: Approval flows, multi-step data processing, Saga Pattern implementation.
-   **Benefit**: State management, error handling, and retries can be defined declaratively.

---

## §5. Firebase Authentication Strategy

### Rule 32.22: Authentication Provider Policy
-   **Mandate**: Use Firebase Authentication as the "authentication layer" and store user data in Supabase.
-   **Recommended Providers**:
    | Provider | Use Case | Priority |
    |---|---|---|
    | Google Sign-In | General user authentication | Highest |
    | Apple Sign-In | iOS apps (App Store requirement) | Required (iOS) |
    | Email/Password | Fallback authentication | Standard |
    | Phone (SMS) | MFA / Phone verification | Optional |
    | Anonymous | Guest access | Limited |
    | SAML/OIDC | Enterprise SSO | As needed |
-   **Prohibited**: Accessing Firestore without authentication is prohibited.

### Rule 32.23: Passkeys / FIDO2 Support
-   **Mandate**: Recommend Passkeys (FIDO2) adoption for passwordless authentication.
-   **Implementation**: Use Firebase Authentication with Identity Platform (GCIP) `Passkey` provider.
-   **Benefit**: Phishing resistance, elimination of password list attacks, improved user UX.

### Rule 32.24: Custom Claims
-   **Mandate**: Use Custom Claims for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
-   **Rules**:
    1.  Set only via Admin SDK (setting from client is prohibited).
    2.  Payload limited to 1000 bytes.
    3.  Changes are not reflected until token refresh. Design with 1-hour grace period.
    ```typescript
    // Admin SDK: Set custom claims
    await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, {
      role: "admin",
      plan: "premium",
    });
    ```

### Rule 32.25: Token Management and Session Design
-   **Mandate**: ID Token TTL defaults to 1 hour. Use Refresh Tokens for long sessions.
-   **Security**:
    1.  Store Refresh Tokens in HTTP-only Cookies. Storage in LocalStorage/SessionStorage is prohibited.
    2.  Implement Token Revocation for immediate invalidation on account compromise.
    3.  Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin and high-privilege users.

### Rule 32.26: Authentication Event Monitoring
-   **Mandate**: Stream authentication events (login, failure, account creation) to Cloud Logging for unauthorized access detection.
-   **Detectable Events**: Abnormal login frequency, geographic anomalies, brute force patterns.

---

## §6. App Check & App Authentication

### Rule 32.27: App Check Mandatory
-   **Mandate**: Enable App Check on all Firebase services (Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Run Functions) and custom backends.
-   **Attestation Providers**:
    | Platform | Provider | Recommended |
    |---|---|---|
    | Android | Play Integrity API | ✅ |
    | iOS | App Attest (Device Check) | ✅ |
    | Web | reCAPTCHA Enterprise | ✅ |
-   **Enforcement Mode**: Enable enforcement mode after confirming sufficient App Check adoption rate (90%+).

### Rule 32.28: App Check for Custom Backends
-   **Mandate**: Verify App Check Tokens on custom backends such as Cloud Run Services.
    ```typescript
    import { getAppCheck } from "firebase-admin/app-check";
    
    async function verifyAppCheck(req: Request): Promise<boolean> {
      const appCheckToken = req.headers["x-firebase-appcheck"];
      if (!appCheckToken) return false;
      
      try {
        await getAppCheck().verifyToken(appCheckToken as string);
        return true;
      } catch {
        return false;
      }
    }
    ```

### Rule 32.29: Replay Protection
-   **Mandate**: Enable App Check Token Replay Protection for high-security operations (payments, personal info changes).
-   **Caution**: Replay Protection requires a new token each time, increasing latency. Not needed for general API calls.

---

## §7. Firestore Design & Security Rules

### Rule 32.30: Firestore Usage Restriction
-   **Mandate**: New data storage in Firestore is prohibited in principle (per Primary Directive 0.1).
-   **Permitted Use Cases**:
    1.  Data requiring real-time listeners (presence, chat, etc.).
    2.  Maintenance of existing Firestore collections.
    3.  Firebase-related configuration data (Remote Config metadata, etc.).

### Rule 32.31: Security Rules Mandatory Pattern
-   **Mandate**: Configure Security Rules on all Firestore databases. Apply Default Deny pattern.
-   **Default Deny**:
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Default: deny all access
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if false;
        }
        
        // Only define explicitly permitted paths
        match /users/{userId} {
          allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
          allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
            && request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['name', 'email'])
            && request.resource.data.name is string
            && request.resource.data.name.size() <= 100;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Rule 32.32: Security Rules Best Practices
-   **Rules**:
    1.  **Authentication Required**: Use `request.auth != null` as the base for all rules.
    2.  **Schema Validation**: Validate type, value, and size of `request.resource.data`.
    3.  **Custom Claims Validation**: Control admin operations with `request.auth.token.role == 'admin'`.
    4.  **Functions**: Use Security Rules Functions for reusable rule logic.
    5.  **Testing Required**: Test all rules with `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` (see §31).
    6.  **Version Control**: Security Rules files must be under Git management.

### Rule 32.33: Firestore Query Optimization
-   **Mandate**: Always consider performance and cost when writing Firestore queries.
-   **Rules**:
    1.  **`.limit()` Required**: Set `limit()` on all queries. Unlimited queries are prohibited.
    2.  **Cursor-based Pagination**: Use `startAfter()`/`endBefore()`.
    3.  **Composite Indexes**: Explicitly define indexes for composite queries.
    4.  **Document Size**: Keep documents small (target: under 10KB).
    5.  **Subcollections**: Use subcollections for large nested data.
    6.  **Caching**: Enable Firestore SDK caching (`enablePersistentCacheIndexAutoCreation`).
    7.  **Hotspot Avoidance**: Do not use sequential values for document IDs.

-   **Mandate**: Use Python 3.12+ (Python 3.13/3.14 also available). Available for Cloud Run Functions and Cloud Run Services.

### Rule 32.164: Genkit Python
-   **Mandate**: Use Genkit Python SDK (Alpha) for building AI workflows in Python.
-   **Caution**: Alpha stage — carefully evaluate stability for production use. Monitor GA schedule.

### Rule 32.165: Type Hints
-   **Mandate**: Add Type Hints to all Python code and check with `mypy`.
    ```python
    from firebase_functions import https_fn
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    class OrderRequest(BaseModel):
        user_id: str
        items: list[dict]
        total: float
    
    @https_fn.on_request()
    def process_order(req: https_fn.Request) -> https_fn.Response:
        order = OrderRequest.model_validate_json(req.data)
        # Business logic
        return https_fn.Response(json.dumps({"status": "ok"}))
    ```

## §53. Python Performance & Testing

### Rule 32.166: Testing
-   **Mandate**: Test with pytest. Support async tests with `pytest-asyncio`.
-   **Coverage**: Measure coverage with `pytest-cov`.

### Rule 32.167: Dependency Management
-   **Mandate**: Manage dependencies with `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. Generate lock files with `pip-tools`. Adoption of `uv` is also recommended.

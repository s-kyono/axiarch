## 0. AWS Cloud Primary Directives

> [!NOTE]
> **§0 Core Philosophy Overview**
> This section defines **the philosophical foundation** for *why* we use AWS and *how* we use it.
> Specific service configuration and implementation rules are delegated to individual sections (§1–§163).
> All 12 principles in Directive 0.1–0.12 serve as the root of every design decision in this file.
> **[Updated 2026-05-04]** Directive 0.9 (Resilience & Chaos), 0.10 (Observability-First), 0.11 (Compliance-by-Design), 0.12 (Ops Excellence Culture) newly added.

### The AWS Way

We choose AWS not merely to "move to the cloud."
We choose it **"to follow the AWS Well-Architected Way and maximize the benefits of cloud-native design."**

Three foundational vows govern all design decisions:

1. **Managed First**: Even when we *could* build and operate something ourselves, if an AWS managed service is a viable alternative, we **always** choose the managed service. "Pride in self-managed infrastructure" is the enemy of scale.
2. **Event-Driven by Default**: Coupling between components is achieved through events (SQS/SNS/EventBridge), not synchronous API calls. This simultaneously delivers loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance.
3. **Immutable Infrastructure**: The standard is to **replace** servers, not **reconfigure** them. Infrastructure is cattle, not pets.

### Core Anti-Patterns (Philosophy-Level Prohibitions)

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Remedy |
|:-------------|:--------|:-----------|:-------|
| **Lift & Shift Thinking** | Recreating on-premises architecture on EC2 | Misunderstanding cloud-native design | Mandate a migration plan to managed services |
| **ClickOps Dependency** | Manually creating/modifying resources in console | Undeveloped IaC culture | Track IaC adoption rate weekly |
| **Monolith in Container** | Containerizing monolith as-is | Failure to implement microservice design | Gradual decomposition via Strangler Fig Pattern |
| **Security as Afterthought** | Adding security config last | DevSecOps not adopted | Apply zero-trust design from Day 0 |
| **Cost Blindness** | Creating resources without cost awareness | Absent FinOps culture | Make cost alerts mandatory for all resources |
| **Single Account Everything** | Running all environments in one AWS account | Misunderstanding multi-account strategy | Isolate via Organizations + Landing Zone |
| **AI Agent = Human Exception** | Granting Admin permissions to AI agents | Failure to adapt to new threat models | Apply least-privilege per Directive 0.7 |
| **Resilience as Afterthought** | Designing for availability only after an outage | Absent failure-first design mindset | Implement chaos engineering per Directive 0.9 |
| **Observability as Debug Tool** | Checking logs only during incidents | Treating observability as a monitoring substitute | Mandate metrics/traces/logs from design Day 0 |
| **Compliance as Checkbox** | Security/compliance review conducted the week before release | Compliance-by-Design not applied | Encode regulatory requirements in IaC and CI pipelines |
| **Heroic Ops Culture** | Incident response dependent on individual "heroes" | Runbook/Game Day culture not cultivated | Systematize and automate operations per Directive 0.12 |

---

### Primary Directive 0.1: The Well-Architected Compliance Mandate
-   **Law**: Compliance with the **AWS Well-Architected Framework's 6 pillars** is mandatory for all AWS infrastructure design, construction, and operations.
    1.  **Operational Excellence**: Automation, IaC, runbook maintenance.
    2.  **Security**: Least privilege, defense in depth, encryption.
    3.  **Reliability**: Multi-AZ/Region, auto-recovery, chaos engineering.
    4.  **Performance Efficiency**: Appropriate service selection, right-sizing.
    5.  **Cost Optimization**: FinOps, waste elimination, commitment strategies.
    6.  **Sustainability**: Resource efficiency, Graviton adoption, region selection. Implement the following concrete actions:
        -   **Customer Carbon Footprint Tool**: Review estimated carbon footprint of your cloud usage in the AWS Console (2024 GA). Review emission trends quarterly and set reduction targets.
        -   **Graviton Priority**: Graviton instances provide up to 60% energy efficiency improvement vs equivalent x86. Evaluate Graviton (see §3.1) as the first candidate for new workloads.
        -   **Resource Efficiency**: Right-sizing based on Compute Optimizer recommendations, unused resource deletion (see §9.3), storage tier optimization via S3 Intelligent-Tiering (see §78).
        -   **Region Selection**: Prioritize regions with higher renewable energy ratios. Refer to AWS [Sustainability Pillar documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/).
-   **Lenses**: Apply the following official lenses as appropriate for your workload (2025 updates).
    -   **Responsible AI Lens**: Governance, bias assessment, fairness, and transparency guidelines for AI/ML workloads.
    -   **Generative AI Lens**: Design and operational guide for generative AI applications using Bedrock / SageMaker JumpStart.
    -   **Machine Learning Lens**: Architecture design guidance for ML pipelines (data collection → training → inference → monitoring).
-   **Action**: Conduct quarterly reviews using the AWS Well-Architected Tool and maintain "zero high-risk items" across all pillars. Always include applicable lens reviews for AI/ML workloads.

### Primary Directive 0.2: The IaC-Only Mandate
-   **Law**: All AWS resources MUST be defined and managed through **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. Manual creation or modification via the AWS Management Console or CLI is considered "destruction of history."
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Code First**: Define all infrastructure changes in code (CloudFormation / CDK / Terraform) and version-control with Git.
    2.  **No ClickOps**: Console usage is restricted to read-only purposes: verifying current values and debugging.
    3.  **Drift Zero Tolerance**: Periodically detect drift using `terraform plan` or CloudFormation Drift Detection. If detected, immediately reflect in code or revert manual changes.
-   **Exception**: Manual changes are permitted only during emergency incident response, with mandatory IaC code reflection within 24 hours.
-   **Reference — Terraform Project Structure Skeleton**:
    ```
    infrastructure/
    ├── environments/
    │   ├── dev/
    │   │   ├── main.tf          # Environment-specific resources
    │   │   ├── variables.tf     # Environment-specific variables
    │   │   ├── terraform.tfvars # Environment values (Git-managed, secrets via SSM/SecretsManager)
    │   │   └── backend.tf       # S3 + DynamoDB state management
    │   ├── staging/
    │   └── production/
    ├── modules/                  # Reusable modules
    │   ├── networking/           # VPC, Subnets, NAT, TGW
    │   ├── compute/             # ECS, Lambda, EC2
    │   ├── database/            # RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache

    └── _global/                 # Organizations, SCPs, IAM Identity Center
    ```
    **State Management Required Config (backend.tf)**:
    ```hcl
    terraform {
      backend "s3" {
        bucket         = "myproject-terraform-state-ACCOUNT_ID"
        key            = "env/dev/terraform.tfstate"
        region         = "ap-northeast-1"
        encrypt        = true
        dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"  # Exclusive lock required
        kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform-state"  # KMS encryption required
      }
    }
    ```

### Primary Directive 0.3: The Trinity DTO Mandate
-   **Purpose**: Same principle as the Supabase constitution (Rule 37). For data passing between AWS services, direct exposure of raw data is prohibited; transformation to purpose-specific DTOs is mandatory.
-   **Mandate**:
    -   **Security**: Physically prevent exposure of unnecessary fields (internal IDs, PII) between API Gateway → Lambda → Client.
    -   **Stability**: Implement a mapper layer so DB schema changes don't directly impact the frontend.
    -   **AI Economy**: Minimize payload to LLM/AI services to reduce token costs.

### Primary Directive 0.4: The Multi-Account Strategy Mandate
-   **Law**: Production workloads MUST NOT operate in a **single AWS account**. Adopt a multi-account strategy using AWS Organizations, separating accounts by environment and responsibility.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Management Account**: Billing consolidation and Organizations management only. No workloads.
    2.  **Security Account**: Delegated administrator for GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudTrail.
    3.  **Log Archive Account**: Centralized destination for all CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and Config Logs. Tamper-proof settings required.
    4.  **Network Account**: Network hub for Transit Gateway, VPN, Direct Connect.
    5.  **Workload Accounts**: Separated by environment (Dev / Staging / Production).
-   **SCP**: Enforce guardrails via SCPs across all accounts: disable unused regions, prohibit root user API usage, etc.
-   **Reference — Deny Unused Regions SCP Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "DenyUnusedRegions",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "NotAction": [
          "iam:*", "sts:*", "organizations:*",
          "support:*", "billing:*", "health:*",
          "cloudfront:*", "route53:*", "wafv2:*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
          "StringNotEquals": {
            "aws:RequestedRegion": [
              "ap-northeast-1",
              "us-east-1"
            ]
          }
        }
      }]
    }
    ```

### Primary Directive 0.5: The Platform Engineering Mandate
-   **Law**: Infrastructure teams must not be "teams that manually create resources upon request." They must be **teams that build and provide a platform enabling development teams to self-service provision infrastructure**.
-   **Philosophy**: To achieve "You build it, you run it," developers need a **Golden Path** — a set of approved, opinionated infrastructure blueprints they can deploy without worrying about infrastructure complexity.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Golden Path Catalog**: Maintain a service catalog (AWS Service Catalog / Internal CDK Constructs) with approved infrastructure patterns (VPC configurations, ECS clusters, RDS clusters, etc.) available for self-service provisioning.
    2.  **Paved Road Over Guard Rails**: Adopt a design philosophy of "making the right path easy" rather than "prohibiting wrong paths via rules." Prioritize building recommended configuration templates over restrictive SCPs.
    3.  **IDP Metrics**: Measure Internal Developer Platform adoption (Golden Path usage rate / total deployments) quarterly. Target 80%+.
    4.  **Backstage / Port Integration**: Integrate with developer portals (Backstage, etc.) to centralize the service catalog, documentation, and on-call information.
-   **Anti-pattern**: Infrastructure teams continuing to operate Ticket-Driven (ticket → manual response). This is a hard ceiling on scale and a bottleneck for development velocity.

### Primary Directive 0.6: The Cost-as-a-Feature Mandate
-   **Law**: Cloud costs are not "incidental infrastructure overhead." They must be defined and managed as **product requirements** from the design phase.
-   **Philosophy**: Writing "code that works" is insufficient. Writing "code that generates profit" is true engineering. Code written without cost awareness is a time bomb that kills the business.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Cost-per-Request Target**: Define a "cost-per-request target" for every API endpoint and batch job, and compare against actuals.
    2.  **Budget as Code**: Manage `aws-budgets` configuration in IaC. Define budget-exceeded actions (alert → auto-stop) as code.
    3.  **Cost Review Gate**: Add "cost impact assessment" as a mandatory item in PR reviews. PRs including new resource provisioning MUST NOT be merged without a monthly cost estimate.
    4.  **Shared Cost Accountability**: Maintain per-team cost dashboards so everyone can see who is spending what. Eliminate the "someone else is paying" mentality.
-   **Reference — Monthly Cost Estimation Checklist (Mandatory PR Item)**:
    ```markdown
    ## Cost Impact Assessment
    - [ ] New resources: [service name] x [qty] ≈ $XXX/month
    - [ ] Data transfer cost: ≈ $XXX/month
    - [ ] Storage cost: ≈ $XXX/month
    - [ ] Total additional cost: ≈ $XXX/month
    - [ ] Impact on existing budget: [No impact / Requires budget adjustment]
    ```
-   **Anti-pattern**: Merging a `db.t3.medium` → `db.r6g.2xlarge` upgrade without a cost estimate. Differences of tens of thousands of dollars per month appear "without anyone noticing."

### Primary Directive 0.7: The Agentic AI Governance Mandate
-   **Law**: When AI agents (Amazon Bedrock Agents / LangChain / AutoGen, etc.) invoke AWS APIs, **the same IAM least-privilege principle as human operators MUST be applied**. Excessive permission grants justified by "it's AI" or "it's automation" are strictly prohibited.
-   **Philosophy**: AI agents are powerful, but if abused (e.g., via Prompt Injection), they can become the most dangerous attack vector. Treat agents as "external systems requiring verification," not "trusted human proxies."
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Agent-Specific IAM Role**: Create dedicated IAM roles for AI agents, permitting only the minimum AWS API actions that agent requires. Never grant AdminPolicy.
    2.  **Scope Limitation**: Separate permissions per tool (Lambda) within Bedrock agent `ActionGroup`. Apply least-privilege policies to each Lambda.
    3.  **Human-in-the-Loop Guardrail**: For actions involving writes, deletions, or IAM changes to production, prohibit autonomous agent execution and always insert a human approval step.
    4.  **Prompt Injection Defense**: Do not trust user input processed by agents. Use Bedrock Guardrails `DENY` filters to detect and block prompt injection attempts.
    5.  **Audit Trail**: Record all agent actions (tools invoked, APIs executed, results) in CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs. Maintain full auditability.
-   **Reference — Minimum-Privilege Lambda Execution Role for Bedrock Agent**:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "dynamodb:Query"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::agent-read-only-bucket/*",
          "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:table/AgentDataTable"
        ]
      }]
    }
    ```
    > **🚫 Prohibited**: `"Action": "*", "Resource": "*"` — Granting Admin permissions to an AI agent creates a zero-day equivalent risk.

### Primary Directive 0.8: The Data Sovereignty & Post-Quantum Readiness Mandate
-   **Law**: Always be aware of "which region your data resides in." Data sovereignty based on legal and regulatory requirements must be guaranteed from the design phase. Simultaneously, migration plans toward **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** in preparation for quantum computer-based decryption must be established now.
-   **Philosophy**: The assumption that "current encryption is secure" is collapsing on a 5–10 year horizon. "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)" attacks are already a present-day threat. Encryption of long-term retention data is a problem of today.

#### 8-A. Data Sovereignty
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Data Residency Map**: For every data category (PII, healthcare, financial, logs, etc.), maintain an explicit data residency map showing "storage region," "processing region," and "backup region."
    2.  **AWS Region Restriction SCP**: Physically prohibit data storage/transfer to unauthorized regions via SCP (see Directive 0.4 SCP example).
    3.  **GDPR / APPI Alignment**: For EU resident user data transfers outside the EU, and Japanese user data transfers abroad, document appropriate legal bases (SCCs, adequacy decisions, etc.).
    4.  **Data Perimeter Enforcement**: Use AWS Organizations Data Perimeter (`aws:SourceAccount`/`aws:PrincipalOrgID` condition keys) to enforce boundaries preventing data exfiltration outside the organization. See §147 for details.

#### 8-B. Post-Quantum Readiness
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **PQC Inventory**: Inventory all currently used cryptographic algorithms (RSA, ECDSA, DH, etc.) and identify algorithms vulnerable to quantum computers.
    2.  **TLS Hybrid Mode**: Track the readiness of AWS KMS / ACM / CloudFront for PQC hybrid TLS (NIST standards: ML-KEM / ML-DSA) and execute migration plans upon GA.
    3.  **Long-Term Data Priority**: Prioritize PQC adoption for sensitive long-term retention data (10+ years). This carries the highest HNDL attack risk.
    4.  **Crypto Agility**: Never hardcode cryptographic algorithms. Externalize them as configuration (Crypto Agility). Mandate designs where future algorithm changes can be implemented without code modifications.
-   **Anti-pattern**: Deferring action because "quantum computers are not yet practical." HNDL attacks are executable today, and long-term retention data is already at risk.

### Primary Directive 0.9: The Resilience & Chaos Engineering Mandate
-   **Law**: In all AWS infrastructure design, **treat "failures will happen" as an immutable premise. Design systems that recover automatically from failure, rather than systems that attempt to prevent failure**.
-   **Philosophy**: "99.99% availability" is not a target — it is the starting point of design. The essential value of cloud is not "never breaking" but "breaking without being noticed." Chaos engineering is the only empirical method to prevent production incidents.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Failure Mode Analysis**: For every component, analyze "if this component fails, how does it impact the system?" during the design phase. Explicitly document Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) in design documents and record decisions to accept, eliminate, or mitigate each.
    2.  **Multi-AZ by Default**: All production compute, database, and cache resources must be distributed across 2+ AZs. Single-AZ placement must pass an approval process as an "intentional design decision" (see §2.1 and §4.1).
    3.  **Graceful Degradation**: Design for "reduced functionality with continued operation" rather than total system shutdown when a dependency fails. Example: product browsing continues when the payment service fails; rule-based fallback activates when AI inference fails.
    4.  **Chaos Engineering Protocol**: Conduct quarterly game days including:
        -   **AZ Failure Simulation**: Zero out traffic to a specific AZ and measure automatic failover and recovery time (RTO).
        -   **Dependency Failure Injection**: Use AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) to inject delays, timeouts, and errors into API/DB/cache layers. Validate Circuit Breaker behavior.
        -   **Network Partition Test**: Block inter-subnet communication within a VPC and verify service independence.
    5.  **Recovery Targets**: Define RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) for all production workloads and validate achievement via game day measurements.
-   **Reference — AWS FIS Fault Injection Experiment Template (ECS Task Termination)**:
    ```json
    {
      "description": "ECS Task Termination - Resilience Test",
      "targets": {
        "ecs-tasks": {
          "resourceType": "aws:ecs:task",
          "resourceTags": { "Environment": "staging" },
          "selectionMode": "PERCENT(30)"
        }
      },
      "actions": {
        "terminate-tasks": {
          "actionId": "aws:ecs:stop-task",
          "targets": { "Tasks": "ecs-tasks" }
        }
      },
      "stopConditions": [{
        "source": "aws:cloudwatch:alarm",
        "value": "arn:aws:cloudwatch:...:alarm:ServiceHealthAlarm"
      }]
    }
    ```
    > **Target**: Stopping 30% of ECS tasks must result in ALB health checks returning all tasks to Healthy within 2 minutes.
-   **Anti-pattern**: Not conducting game days because "it's too risky in production." An incident without a game day is equivalent to combat without any training. Conduct regularly in Staging and expand to production incrementally.

### Primary Directive 0.10: The Observability-First Mandate
-   **Law**: Observability is not something "added after the system is running." It must be **built into the design from Day 0**. The three pillars — logs, metrics, and traces — are treated as first-class citizens on par with code.
-   **Philosophy**: "We have logs, so we can observe" is an illusion. True observability is "the ability to identify the cause of an unknown failure by asking questions from the outside alone."
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **The Three Pillars (Mandatory)**:
        -   **Metrics**: Instrument all services with Golden Signals (latency, error rate, throughput, saturation) and send as CloudWatch custom metrics.
        -   **Traces**: Attach a `TraceId` to every request. Implement cross-service-boundary distributed tracing via X-Ray or OpenTelemetry (OTEL) (see §7.3).
        -   **Logs**: Output all logs in JSON structured format with `service`, `environment`, `trace_id`, and `request_id` as required fields.
    2.  **Structured Logging Standard**:
        -   Required fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `trace_id`, `request_id`, `message`
        -   Prohibited: Free-text logs (`console.log("Error: " + err)`). Logs that cannot be machine-parsed are noise, not logs.
    3.  **SLO-Driven Alerting**:
        -   Define SLIs (Service Level Indicators) and SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for all production services.
        -   Alert based on SLO "Error Budget consumption rate" to reduce over-reliance on individual metric threshold alerts.
        -   Example: "Alert PagerDuty when error rate has consumed 50% of the Error Budget in the past 1 hour."
    4.  **Observability as Code**: Define all CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and Log Metric Filters in IaC and version-control in Git. Treat "manually created dashboards" as configuration drift.
-   **Reference — Golden Signals CloudWatch Alarm Template (CDK)**:
    ```typescript
    // Golden Signals: Latency P99 Alarm
    new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'LatencyP99Alarm', {
      metric: new cloudwatch.Metric({
        namespace: 'MyService',
        metricName: 'LatencyP99',
        dimensionsMap: { ServiceName: 'OrderAPI' },
        statistic: 'p99',
        period: cdk.Duration.minutes(1),
      }),
      threshold: 500,          // 500ms SLO
      evaluationPeriods: 3,
      comparisonOperator: cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD,
      treatMissingData: cloudwatch.TreatMissingData.BREACHING,
      alarmDescription: 'OrderAPI P99 latency exceeded 500ms SLO for 3 consecutive minutes',
    });
    ```
-   **Anti-pattern**: "We'll build dashboards later." Enabling X-Ray for the first time during a production incident. These are design failures that repeat with every outage.

### Primary Directive 0.11: The Shared Responsibility & Compliance-by-Design Mandate
-   **Law**: Deeply understand AWS's **Shared Responsibility Model** so that every engineer recognizes "what AWS guarantees" vs. "what we must guarantee." Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.) are not "things checked before release" — they are **embedded in the design and code from the start**.
-   **Philosophy**: AWS guarantees the security "of" the cloud (physical infrastructure). However, the security "in" the cloud — what runs on that infrastructure, what data it holds, who can access it — is 100% our responsibility. "It's AWS, so it's secure" is an abdication of responsibility.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Responsibility Boundary Map**: Every team must understand and document:
        -   **AWS's Responsibility**: Physical infrastructure, hypervisor, managed service patches, global network.
        -   **Our Responsibility**: OS/app patches, IAM configuration, data encryption, network configuration, application code, data classification, access control, incident response.
    2.  **Compliance as Code**:
        -   Implement regulatory requirements (GDPR Article 25 Privacy by Design, etc.) as AWS Config Rules, SCPs, and IaC policies.
        -   Convert "compliance requirement checklists" into automated CI/CD pipeline tests that block non-compliant deployments.
        -   Example: "All S3 buckets must have encryption enabled" validated automatically via AWS Config rule.
    3.  **Data Classification Protocol**:
        -   Assign "sensitivity levels" (Public / Internal / Confidential / Restricted) to all data assets and apply encryption, access control, and logging corresponding to that level.
        -   Use **Amazon Macie** for automatic detection and classification of data containing PII (see §119).
    4.  **Audit-Ready by Default**:
        -   CloudTrail, Config, and Security Hub are "always-running infrastructure," not "things enabled when an audit arrives."
        -   Guarantee tamper-proof audit trails (logs, config change history) via Object Lock (WORM).
-   **Reference — Automated Encryption Policy by Data Classification Tag (SCP)**:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "DenyUnencryptedObjectsForConfidentialBuckets",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": { "s3:prefix": ["confidential/", "restricted/"] },
          "StringNotEquals": { "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms" }
        }
      }]
    }
    ```
-   **Anti-pattern**: An organizational structure where compliance teams conduct "security reviews one week before release." This defers problems and causes the cost of fixing discovered risks to grow exponentially.

### Primary Directive 0.12: The Operational Excellence Culture Mandate
-   **Law**: Operations are not the "cleanup" of engineering — they are a **core engineering activity that constitutes product quality and reliability**. The cultural shift from "it just needs to work" to "it must sustainably operate at scale" must be achieved through concrete processes and measurement.
-   **Philosophy**: Organizations that depend on "heroic incident response" collapse as they scale. Incidents are not solved by individual heroism — they are prevented and auto-recovered by team systems and culture.
-   **Mandate**:
    1.  **Runbook Mandate**:
        -   Maintain a **Runbook** for every service deployed to production. Deployment without a runbook is an "incomplete release."
        -   Minimum required contents: architecture overview, dependency map, health check URLs, alert catalog, incident response flow, rollback procedures, escalation contacts.
        -   Runbooks are managed in the same repository as code and updated via the same code review process.
    2.  **Postmortem Culture**:
        -   Conduct a Blameless Postmortem for every P1/P2 production incident within 48 hours of resolution and document it within 72 hours.
        -   The purpose of postmortems is not "finding who is at fault" but "discovering system vulnerabilities and driving improvement."
        -   Every Action Item must have an owner and deadline, with progress reviewed in the next postmortem.
    3.  **Game Day Protocol**:
        -   Conduct quarterly planned "Game Days" (linked to Directive 0.9's Chaos Engineering Protocol).
        -   Position game days as "validation experiments for Runbooks" — a venue for discovering procedural gaps and automation deficiencies.
        -   Record results in the same format as postmortems and iterate on improvements.
    4.  **Automation-First Operations**:
        -   All recurring manual operational tasks (scaling, certificate renewal, patching, backup verification) are candidates for automation.
        -   Apply the principle "automate any task performed twice" and measure automation rate (automated tasks / all recurring tasks) quarterly. Target: **90%+**.
        -   Prioritize automation of recurring tasks using EventBridge Scheduler, Systems Manager Automation, and Step Functions.
    5.  **Operational Metrics (DORA)**:
        -   Measure the DORA 4 metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, Mean Time to Recovery) and conduct monthly team reviews.
        -   Elite performer targets: Deployment Frequency ≥ weekly, Lead Time ≤ 1 day, Change Failure Rate ≤ 5%, MTTR ≤ 1 hour.
-   **Reference — DORA Metrics CloudWatch Design (CDK)**:
    ```typescript
    // Send deployment frequency as a custom metric (CDK / CodePipeline integration)
    const deployFrequencyMetric = new cloudwatch.Metric({
      namespace: 'DORA/Metrics',
      metricName: 'DeploymentFrequency',
      dimensionsMap: { ServiceName: 'OrderAPI', Environment: 'production' },
      statistic: 'Sum',
      period: cdk.Duration.days(7),
    });

    // Change failure rate alarm (threshold: alert above 5%)
    new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'ChangeFailureRateAlarm', {
      metric: new cloudwatch.MathExpression({
        expression: 'failed_deploys / total_deploys * 100',
        usingMetrics: {
          failed_deploys: failedDeployMetric,
          total_deploys: totalDeployMetric,
        },
      }),
      threshold: 5,
      evaluationPeriods: 1,
      alarmDescription: 'Change failure rate exceeded 5% (DORA Elite target)',
    });
    ```
-   **Anti-pattern**: "We'll figure out the response when an incident happens." "The runbook is in my head." "We'll do the retrospective next sprint." These are all symptoms of heroic ops dependency. Only systematization, automation, and documentation realize a scalable operations organization.

## 1. IAM Security Strategy

### Rule 1.1: The Least Privilege Iron Rule
-   **Law**: All IAM entities (users, roles, policies) MUST be granted **only the minimum permissions necessary** to perform their tasks.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **No Wildcard Actions**: Prohibit wildcard permissions like `"Action": "s3:*"` or `"Resource": "*"` in production. Explicitly specify all actions and resource ARNs.
    2.  **IAM Access Analyzer**: Regularly run IAM Access Analyzer to detect unintended external access.
    3.  **Permission Boundaries**: Restrict maximum permissions for roles created by administrators using Permission Boundaries.
    4.  **Customer Managed Policies**: Use AWS managed policies as initial templates only. Create customer managed policies with minimum required permissions for production.
-   **Reference — Least Privilege IAM Policy Example (Lambda S3 Read-Only)**:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "AllowS3ReadSpecificBucket",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:ListBucket"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-data-bucket",
          "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-data-bucket/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
          }
        }
      }]
    }
    ```
    > **⚠️ Anti-pattern**: `"Action": "s3:*", "Resource": "*"` — grants full access to all buckets, maximizing data leak and deletion risk.

### Rule 1.2: The Credential Hygiene Protocol
-   **Law**: Prohibit long-term credentials (access keys) in principle. Adopt temporary credentials (IAM roles + STS) universally.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **No Long-Term Keys**: Prohibit creating IAM user access keys. Use instance profiles for EC2, IAM roles for Lambda, OIDC federation for CI/CD.
    2.  **Federated Identity**: Use IAM Identity Center (formerly SSO) for human access, integrated with external IdPs (Okta, Azure AD, etc.).
    3.  **Key Rotation**: If long-term keys are unavoidable, automate rotation within 90 days. Delete unused keys immediately.
    4.  **Root Account Lock**: Never create root user access keys. Enable MFA and completely prohibit root for daily operations. Set CloudWatch alarms for root account activity.

### Rule 1.3: The MFA Enforcement Protocol
-   **Law**: Enforce **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** on all IAM users and root accounts.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Hardware MFA for Root**: Use hardware MFA devices (YubiKey, etc.) for root accounts.
    2.  **SCP Enforcement**: Apply SCPs across the Organization to deny API calls without MFA.
    3.  **Condition Keys**: Require `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` in IAM policy conditions for critical actions (IAM policy changes, S3 bucket deletion, etc.).

### Rule 1.4: The Cross-Account Access Protocol
-   **Law**: Implement cross-account access via **IAM role delegation (AssumeRole)**, not access key sharing.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Trust Policy**: Explicitly specify allowed account IDs and ExternalId in trust policies.
    2.  **Session Duration**: Set session time to the minimum required for the task (recommended: 1 hour or less).
    3.  **Audit**: Monitor cross-account AssumeRole events via CloudTrail and detect anomalous access patterns.

---

## 2. Network Design Standards

### Rule 2.1: The VPC Architecture Protocol
-   **Law**: Place workloads in properly designed VPCs and minimize direct public internet exposure.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **CIDR Planning**: Plan VPC CIDR blocks to avoid overlap with on-premises networks and peering targets. Ensure room for future expansion. IPv6 dual-stack recommended.
    2.  **Multi-AZ**: Distribute all production workloads across at least 2 AZs (3 recommended).
    3.  **Subnet Separation**: Standardize on a 3-tier subnet architecture: Public / Private / Isolated (DB-dedicated).
        -   **Public Subnet**: Only ALB, NAT Gateway, Bastion hosts.
        -   **Private Subnet**: Application servers (EC2, ECS, Lambda VPC connections).
        -   **Isolated Subnet**: Data stores (RDS, ElastiCache). No internet route.
    4.  **VPC Block Public Access**: Enable **Amazon VPC Block Public Access** at the account level to declaratively control VPC internet access (2024 GA).
        -   **Bidirectional Block**: Block all inbound and outbound internet traffic for all VPCs (most restrictive).
        -   **Ingress-Only Block**: Block inbound only; allow outbound (via NAT Gateway, etc.).
        -   **Exclusions**: Specific VPCs or subnets can be excluded (e.g., VPCs with public ALBs). Supports IPv4/IPv6.
        -   **SCP Integration**: Combine with SCPs to prohibit disabling Block Public Access organization-wide.
-   **Reference — CIDR Design Standards Table**:
    | VPC Purpose | CIDR Example | Subnet Size | Notes |
    |:------------|:-------------|:------------|:------|
    | Production | `10.1.0.0/16` | `/24` per subnet (251 IPs) | EKS recommends `/19` (high Pod IP consumption) |
    | Staging | `10.2.0.0/16` | `/24` per subnet | No overlap with Production |
    | Dev | `10.3.0.0/16` | `/24` per subnet | VPC Peering compatible |
    | Shared Services | `10.0.0.0/16` | `/24` per subnet | DNS, AD, Monitoring |
    > **⚠️ Anti-pattern**: Using same CIDR across all environments — makes VPC Peering/Transit Gateway impossible. Create a CIDR map for all VPCs during planning.

### Rule 2.2: The Security Group Discipline
-   **Law**: Configure Security Groups using a **least-privilege whitelist approach**. Prohibit unnecessary port exposure.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **No 0.0.0.0/0 Inbound**: Strictly prohibit `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH (22) or RDP (3389) inbound rules. Use bastion hosts or SSM Session Manager.
    2.  **SG Reference**: Allow inter-tier communication by referencing Security Group IDs, not IP ranges.
    3.  **Tier Isolation**: Create dedicated Security Groups per tier (Web, App, DB) with rules limited to minimum required ports/protocols.

### Rule 2.3: The NACL Defense Layer
-   **Law**: Implement NACLs as an additional defense layer with explicit deny rules at the subnet level.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Explicit Deny**: Add explicit deny rules for known malicious IP ranges and unnecessary protocols.
    2.  **Stateless Awareness**: NACLs are stateless. When allowing inbound, also allow corresponding ephemeral port range outbound.
    3.  **Rule Ordering**: Rules are evaluated in number order. Place deny rules before (lower numbers than) allow rules.

### Rule 2.4: The VPC Endpoint Mandate
-   **Law**: Access from VPCs to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SQS, KMS, etc.) MUST use **VPC Endpoints** for private connectivity, not Internet Gateways or NAT Gateways.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Gateway Endpoint**: Always create Gateway endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB (free).
    2.  **Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink)**: Create Interface endpoints for other AWS services (KMS, STS, ECR, CloudWatch Logs, etc.) to keep traffic within AWS.
    3.  **Endpoint Policy**: Set policies on VPC endpoints to permit only specific resource access (e.g., specific S3 buckets), building a data perimeter.

### Rule 2.5: The NAT Gateway Resilience
-   **Law**: Use NAT Gateways for outbound internet from private subnets, ensuring high availability.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **AZ NAT Gateway (Traditional)**: Deploy one NAT Gateway per AZ to prevent outbound communication disruption during AZ failure. Choose when AZ-level fault isolation is required.
    2.  **Regional NAT Gateway (Recommended — November 2025 GA)**: Deploy a **single NAT Gateway at the regional level** that automatically scales across AZs where workloads exist. No public subnet placement required. Built-in port exhaustion protection for stable operation at scale. Significantly reduces operational overhead.
    3.  **Selection Criteria**: Default to Regional NAT Gateway for new environments. For existing environments with per-AZ NAT GWs, evaluate migration based on cost comparison (attachment count × pricing) and operational simplification.
    4.  **Monitoring**: Monitor CloudWatch metrics (`BytesOutToDestination`, `PacketsDropCount`, `ErrorPortAllocation`). Regional NAT GW auto-prevents port exhaustion, but alerts for anomalous traffic increases are mandatory.
-   **Anti-pattern**: Deploying individual NAT Gateways across all AZs, increasing management costs. Simplify with Regional NAT Gateway.
-   **Cross-Ref**: Transit Gateway in §130. VPC networking in §2.

### Rule 2.6: The Transit Gateway Hub
-   **Law**: When connecting 3+ VPCs, use **Transit Gateway** as a hub instead of VPC peering mesh.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Route Table Segregation**: Assign dedicated route tables per VPC to block unnecessary inter-VPC communication.
    2.  **Network Firewall Integration**: Integrate with AWS Network Firewall for inter-VPC traffic inspection and filtering.
    3.  **Encryption**: Enable encryption for Transit Gateway communications.

### Rule 2.7: The VPC Lattice Service Networking
-   **Law**: Use **Amazon VPC Lattice** for microservice-to-microservice communication to simplify service networking (2024 GA).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Service Network**: Create VPC Lattice service networks to enable cross-VPC and cross-account service communication without VPC peering or Transit Gateway.
    2.  **Auth Policy**: Apply IAM authentication policies for zero-trust service-to-service communication.
    3.  **Weighted Routing**: Implement canary deployments via VPC Lattice's weighted routing traffic management.
    4.  **Observability**: Send access logs to CloudWatch Logs / S3 / Kinesis Data Firehose for service communication visibility.
-   **Use Case**: Recommended as a service mesh alternative for mixed ECS/EKS/Lambda/EC2 environments. Eliminates need for sidecar proxies (Envoy etc.) for simplified operations.

### Rule 2.8: The VPC Block Public Access (Account-Level Public Blocking)
-   **Law**: Enable **VPC Block Public Access** across all accounts to physically block unintended public internet connectivity (2024 GA).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Account-Level Enforcement**: Enable VPC Block Public Access at the account level. Block inbound/outbound traffic via Internet Gateways (IGW) by default.
    2.  **Exclusion Management**: Explicitly register only VPCs/subnets requiring public access (e.g., public subnets for ALBs) in the exclusion list. Keep exclusions minimal.
    3.  **Organizations Deployment**: Recommend Organizations-wide policy or SCP enforcement for all accounts. Fundamentally eliminate public exposure from Shadow IT or developer misconfigurations.
    4.  **Audit**: Detect BPA disabling or exclusion changes via AWS Config Rules and immediately alert on unauthorized modifications.
-   **Anti-pattern**: Relying only on Security Groups for public access control without BPA. Human error in SG configuration cannot be prevented.

---

## 3. Compute Strategy

### Rule 3.1: The Right-Sizing Mandate
-   **Law**: Regularly analyze compute resource usage and **right-size** accordingly.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **AWS Compute Optimizer**: Monthly review of Compute Optimizer recommendations for all EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and ECS tasks.
    2.  **CloudWatch Metrics**: Continuously monitor CPU, memory, and network I/O. Instances with average utilization below 30% are downsizing candidates.
    3.  **Graviton First**: Default to ARM-based **Graviton instances** for new workloads. Up to 40% better price-performance vs x86.

        | Generation | Instance Examples | Key Features |
        |:-----------|:-----------------|:-------------|
        | Graviton3 | C7g, M7g, R7g | 25% higher performance than Graviton2, 2x floating-point performance |
        | Graviton4 | C8g, M8g, R8g | 30% higher performance than Graviton3, 75% more memory bandwidth |
        | **Graviton5** | **M9g, C9g, R9g** | **192 cores/chip, 3nm process, 25% compute performance improvement over Graviton4, 30% faster for databases, 35% faster for Web/ML workloads, 5x L3 cache (2.6x per core), 15% higher network bandwidth, 20% higher EBS bandwidth, Nitro Isolation Engine (re:Invent 2025+)** |

        > Note: Evaluate latest generation (Graviton5 / M9g) first for new workloads and verify compatibility. C9g (compute-intensive) and R9g (memory-intensive) expected in 2026.

### Rule 3.2: The Lambda Best Practices
-   **Law**: Pursue cold start minimization, memory optimization, and cost efficiency in Lambda function design.
-   **Cross-Ref**: For stable, high-traffic workloads, consider **Lambda Managed Instances** (§108). Run Lambda on EC2 instances with Savings Plans/RI cost optimization.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Memory-CPU Tuning**: Lambda memory allocation is proportional to CPU (1,769MB = 1 vCPU). Use **AWS Lambda Power Tuning** to identify optimal memory settings.
    2.  **Cold Start Mitigation**:
        -   Minimize deployment packages (remove unused dependencies, use Lambda Layers).
        -   Enable **SnapStart** for up to 90% cold start reduction:
            -   **Java**: Initialization snapshot for dramatic cold start reduction (GA).
            -   **Python** (2024 GA): Enable with `snapstart: ApplyOn: PublishedVersions`. Accelerates heavy initialization (boto3/pandas, etc.).
            -   **.NET** (2024 GA): .NET 8+ supported. Ideal for DI/EFCore initialization acceleration.
        -   Prefer Node.js/Python runtimes (smallest cold starts). Go/Rust also high-performance.
        -   Initialize SDK clients and DB connections outside the handler (INIT phase) for reuse in Warm Invocations.
        -   **ARM64 (Graviton2)**: Specify `arm64` architecture to run on Graviton (20% cheaper, up to 34% higher performance vs x86). Default to ARM64 for new functions.
    3.  **Provisioned Concurrency**: Apply to latency-critical functions (payments, auth) to eliminate cold starts.
    4.  **Response Streaming**: Use **Lambda Response Streaming** for large response workloads (report generation, LLM streaming, etc.). Stream up to 20MB beyond the traditional 6MB payload limit. Dramatically improves Time to First Byte (TTFB). Available via Function URL or CloudFront.
    5.  **Function Design**: Single responsibility per function. Set appropriate timeouts. Guarantee idempotency. Prohibit monolithic Lambdas.
    6.  **VPC Attachment**: Only when truly necessary. RDS Proxy, DynamoDB, and external APIs are accessible without VPC.
    7.  **Advanced Logging Controls**: Output Lambda function logs in **JSON structured format** (2024 GA). Control application-level log levels (INFO/WARN/ERROR) from Lambda configuration. Dramatically improves CloudWatch Logs Insights analysis efficiency.
-   **Reference — Lambda Cold Start Minimization Pattern (Node.js)**:
    ```typescript
    // ✅ Initialize in INIT phase (reused in Warm Invocations)
    import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
    const client = new DynamoDBClient({});  // Instantiate outside handler

    export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent) => {
      // ✅ Idempotency key to prevent duplicate execution
      const idempotencyKey = event.headers['x-idempotency-key'];
      if (!idempotencyKey) {
        return { statusCode: 400, body: 'Missing idempotency key' };
      }
      // ... business logic
    };
    ```
-   **Reference — Lambda Memory Cost Indicators**:
    | Memory (MB) | vCPU | Price (USD/ms) | Recommended Use |
    |:-----------|:----------|:-------------|:--------|
    | 128 | 0.07 vCPU | $0.0000000021 | Lightweight triggers/event filters |
    | 512 | 0.29 vCPU | $0.0000000083 | API handlers |
    | 1769 | 1 vCPU | $0.0000000292 | Standard business logic |
    | 3008 | 1.7 vCPU | $0.0000000496 | Data processing/image conversion |
    | 10240 | 6 vCPU | $0.0000001668 | ML inference/heavy computation |

### Rule 3.3: The Container Strategy (ECS / EKS)
-   **Law**: Use managed services (ECS / EKS) for container workloads. Prohibit self-managed container orchestration.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Fargate First**: Default to **AWS Fargate**. EC2 launch type only for GPU or custom kernel requirements.
    2.  **EKS Auto Mode**: When using EKS, strongly recommend adopting **EKS Auto Mode** (re:Invent 2025 GA). Fully automates compute, storage, and networking management, eliminating manual Karpenter configuration and add-on management.
        -   EKS Auto Mode automatically selects optimal EC2 instance types and dynamically scales resources.
        -   Core add-ons (CoreDNS, kube-proxy, VPC CNI, etc.) are automatically upgraded.
        -   Provides a Kubernetes-conformant data plane, allowing teams to focus on application development.
        -   **Note**: Choose Managed Node Groups/Self-Managed for advanced node customization (custom AMIs, specific kernel parameters, etc.).
    3.  **Image Security**: Enable ECR image scanning. Prohibit deploying images with Critical/High vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Task Sizing**: Right-size ECS task/Pod resources based on Container Insights metrics.
    5.  **Secrets Injection**: Never hardcode credentials. Inject from **Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store** at runtime.

### Rule 3.4: The Auto Scaling Protocol
-   **Law**: Configure **Auto Scaling** for all production workloads. Prohibit manual scaling dependency.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Target Tracking**: Use CPU utilization 70% target as baseline, plus custom metrics (queue depth, request count).
    2.  **Predictive Scaling**: Enable for predictable traffic patterns to pre-provision capacity.
    3.  **Scale-In Protection**: Protect stateful tasks (long-running batch) from termination.
    4.  **Cooldown**: Set appropriate cooldown periods to prevent flapping.

### Rule 3.5: The App Runner Strategy
-   **Law**: Consider **AWS App Runner** for simple web application/API container deployments. Fully abstracts VPC/ALB/Auto Scaling infrastructure, letting developers focus on code.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Use Case**: Ideal for stateless web apps/REST APIs that don't require custom networking or sidecars. Also recommended for individual microservice deployment.
    2.  **Source**: Auto-deploy from ECR images or GitHub repositories. Enable auto-deploy on push.
    3.  **VPC Connector**: Configure VPC connector when access to private resources (RDS/ElastiCache) is needed.
    4.  **Auto Scaling**: Concurrent request-based auto-scaling. Min instances 1, max 25 (default). Leverage Pause/Resume for cost optimization.
    5.  **Observability**: Auto-integrated CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray tracing. Custom metrics emission supported.
-   **vs Fargate**: App Runner = infrastructure abstraction (PaaS-like). Fargate = when fine-grained network/task control is needed. Prefer ECS/Fargate for complex microservice architectures.

---

## 4. Database Strategy

### Rule 4.1: The RDS / Aurora Best Practices
-   **Law**: Use managed services (RDS / Aurora) for relational databases. Prohibit self-managed DB on EC2 in principle.

    7.  **Aurora Limitless Database**: For petabyte-scale data and millions of TPS requirements, consider **Aurora Limitless Database** (2024 GA, PostgreSQL-compatible):
        -   **Router + Shard Group**: Router automatically routes queries to appropriate Shards. No application-level sharding logic required.
        -   **Distributed Transactions**: Aurora transparently manages distributed transactions across Shards. Horizontal scaling while maintaining ACID guarantees.
        -   **Table Classification**: Properly design Reference Tables (replicated across all Shards) and Sharded Tables (distributed by key). Small master tables as Reference, large transactional tables as Sharded.
        -   **Limitations**: Foreign key constraint limitations. Referential integrity may require application-layer management.
    8.  **Aurora I/O-Optimized**: Select **I/O-Optimized** cluster configuration for workloads where I/O cost exceeds **25% of monthly DB cost**. No I/O charges, up to 40% cost reduction for I/O-intensive workloads. Available for both Provisioned and Serverless v2.

        | Tag Key | Purpose | Example |
        |:--------|:--------|:--------|
        | `Environment` | Environment ID | `production`, `staging`, `dev` |
        | `Project` | Project ID | `example-app`, `admin-portal` |
        | `Owner` | Responsible party | `team-backend`, `user@example.com` |
        | `CostCenter` | Cost allocation | `engineering`, `marketing` |
        | `ManagedBy` | Management method | `terraform`, `cdk`, `manual` |

    2.  **Enforcement**: Enforce tagging via AWS Config Rule `required-tags` or SCPs. Reject creation of untagged resources.
    3.  **No PII in Tags**: Prohibit PII (personally identifiable information) in tags. Tags are unencrypted and accessible from many AWS services.
    4.  **Automation**: Define default tags in IaC templates to eliminate dependency on manual tagging.

### Rule 8.5: The IaC Generator & Reverse Engineering Protocol
-   **Law**: Use **IaC Generator** and **CDK Migrate** to bring existing AWS resources (manually created/legacy environments) under IaC management.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **IaC Generator (CloudFormation)**: Scan existing resources from the AWS Console to auto-generate CloudFormation templates. Use as the first step for IaC-ifying manually created resources. Always review and adjust generated templates before Git management.
    2.  **CDK Migrate**: Convert existing CloudFormation/Terraform templates or manually created resources to CDK code. Generated as L1 Constructs—incrementally refactor to L2/L3.
    3.  **Terraform Import**: Use `terraform import` + `terraform plan` to incorporate existing resources into Terraform state, then create HCL code. Codify imports using Import Block syntax (Terraform 1.5+).
    4.  **Gradual Approach**: Bulk conversion of all resources is risky. Apply sequentially starting with non-critical environments (Dev), confirming zero `plan` diff before extending to production.
    5.  **Drift Prevention**: Immediately enable Config Rules/Drift Detection after IaC conversion to detect console-based changes.
-   **Anti-pattern**: Using IaC Generator output directly as production templates. Always perform modularization and variable extraction refactoring on auto-generated code.

    2.  **Security Hub Standards**: Enable corresponding compliance standards (CIS, PCI-DSS, etc.) in Security Hub.
    3.  **Config Conformance Packs**: Apply industry-standard Config Conformance Packs for automated compliance checks.
    4.  **Evidence Collection**: Build mechanisms to automatically collect and store CloudTrail logs, Config snapshots, and Security Hub findings for audit response.

### Rule 14.2: The Service Control Policy (SCP) & Resource Control Policies (RCPs) Governance
-   **Law**: Enforce multi-layered security guardrails organization-wide using **SCPs** (principal-based) and **RCPs** (resource-based) in AWS Organizations.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Region Restriction**: Use SCPs to explicitly limit permitted Regions and deny resource creation in unapproved Regions.
    2.  **Root User Restriction**: Use SCPs to deny root user API operations (key creation, password changes, etc.).
    3.  **Critical Service Protection**: Use SCPs to deny disabling of CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Config, and other security services.
    4.  **VPC Flow Log Enforcement**: Enforce Flow Log enablement on VPC creation.
    5.  **Resource Control Policies (RCPs)**: Apply **RCPs** as resource-level preventive guardrails to build Data Perimeters (re:Invent 2025+).
        -   **SCP vs RCP**: SCPs control "who can do what" (principal-based). RCPs control "who can access a resource" (resource-based). Combine both for complete perimeter.
        -   **S3 Data Perimeter**: Use RCPs to restrict S3 bucket external access to Organization-internal only. Prevent unintended external exposure from resource policy misconfigurations at organizational level.
        -   **Scope**: Applicable at OU or account level. Roll out incrementally and evaluate impact in `DryRun` mode.

### Rule 14.3: The Resource Lifecycle Protocol
-   **Law**: Manage AWS resource lifecycle (creation→operation→decommission) to prevent orphaned resources.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Creation Approval**: Mandate IaC PR-based review and approval for production resource creation.
    2.  **Expiration Tag**: Attach `ExpiresAt` tags to temporary resources (test instances, etc.) and configure auto-deletion.
    3.  **Decommission Checklist**: On resource decommission, simultaneously clean up related resources (security groups, IAM roles, DNS, target groups, etc.).

## 15. Sustainability

### Rule 15.1: The Carbon-Aware Architecture
-   **Law**: Minimize environmental impact based on the AWS Well-Architected Sustainability pillar. Treat sustainability as a "measurable and manageable non-functional requirement."
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Graviton Adoption**: Graviton processors (ARM-based) provide up to 60% energy efficiency improvement vs equivalent x86 instances. Actively adopt where compatible. Latest generation (Graviton5, 3nm process) delivers further efficiency gains.
    2.  **AWS Green Insights**: Leverage the **AWS Green Insights** tool in the AWS Console for comprehensive sustainability management:
        -   Track and visualize cloud infrastructure carbon footprint by resource and service.
        -   Receive and act on specific energy efficiency optimization recommendations (Graviton migration, off-peak scale-down, etc.).
        -   Record monthly CO2 emission reductions in dashboards and drive quantitative improvements.
    3.  **Region Selection**: Consider each Region's renewable energy ratio published by AWS when selecting Regions. AWS achieved 100% renewable energy in 2025. Prioritize workload placement in low-carbon Regions.
    4.  **Right-Sizing**: Over-provisioning wastes energy. Implement continuous right-sizing based on Compute Optimizer recommendations.
    5.  **Serverless**: Serverless architectures (Lambda, Fargate, Aurora Serverless) approach zero resource consumption during idle periods, making them recommended from a sustainability perspective.
    6.  **Data Lifecycle**: Retaining unnecessary data requires storage server operation. Implement proper data deletion via lifecycle policies.
    7.  **Sustainability Metrics**: Regularly review Scope 1/2/3 emissions via Customer Carbon Footprint Tool. Integrate sustainability KPIs into dashboards and produce quarterly improvement reports.
    8.  **Sustainability KPI Dashboard**: Integrate sustainability metrics into CloudWatch custom dashboards, enabling engineering teams to routinely monitor environmental impact.

## 17. Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture

### Rule 17.1: The SQS Best Practices
-   **Law**: Use **Amazon SQS** for asynchronous inter-service communication and loose coupling.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Standard vs FIFO**: Standard for best-effort ordering; FIFO for strict ordering and exactly-once processing.
    2.  **DLQ Mandatory**: Configure DLQ on all SQS queues with `maxReceiveCount` (typically 3-5). Monitor DLQ `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` with CloudWatch alarms.
    3.  **DLQ Redrive**: Establish redrive procedures to reprocess DLQ messages after root cause resolution.
    4.  **Visibility Timeout**: Set to ~6x the processing time to prevent duplicate processing.
    5.  **Long Polling**: Set `WaitTimeSeconds` to max 20 seconds. Prohibit short polling.
    6.  **FIFO MessageGroupId**: Design for parallel processing across message groups while maintaining order within each group.
    7.  **Deduplication**: Enable content-based deduplication or provide explicit `MessageDeduplicationId` for FIFO queues.
    8.  **Encryption**: Enable SQS SSE with KMS CMK.
-   **Reference — SQS + DLQ Terraform Configuration Example**:
    ```hcl
    # Dead Letter Queue
    resource "aws_sqs_queue" "orders_dlq" {
      name                      = "orders-dlq"
      message_retention_seconds = 1209600  # 14 days retention
      kms_master_key_id         = aws_kms_key.sqs.arn
    }

    # Main Queue
    resource "aws_sqs_queue" "orders" {
      name                       = "orders-queue"
      visibility_timeout_seconds = 180   # ~6x processing time
      receive_wait_time_seconds  = 20    # Long Polling required
      kms_master_key_id          = aws_kms_key.sqs.arn

      redrive_policy = jsonencode({
        deadLetterTargetArn = aws_sqs_queue.orders_dlq.arn
        maxReceiveCount     = 3  # DLQ after 3 failures
      })
    }

    # DLQ Monitoring Alarm
    resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "dlq_alarm" {
      alarm_name          = "orders-dlq-messages"
      namespace           = "AWS/SQS"
      metric_name         = "ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible"
      dimensions          = { QueueName = aws_sqs_queue.orders_dlq.name }
      statistic           = "Sum"
      period              = 300
      evaluation_periods  = 1
      threshold           = 1     # Alert on even 1 message
      comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
      alarm_actions       = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
    }
    ```

### Rule 17.2: The SNS Fan-Out Protocol
-   **Law**: Use **Amazon SNS** for fan-out patterns where one event must be delivered to multiple consumers.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **SNS + SQS Fan-Out**: Subscribe multiple SQS queues to SNS topics for independent consumer processing.
    2.  **Message Filtering**: Use subscription filter policies so each consumer receives only relevant messages.
    3.  **FIFO Topic**: Required when delivering to SQS FIFO queues (Standard topic → FIFO queue is not supported).
    4.  **DLQ for Subscriptions**: Configure DLQs on SNS subscriptions for delivery failure tracking.
    5.  **Encryption**: Enable SNS SSE with KMS CMK.

### Rule 17.3: The EventBridge Strategy

-   **Action**:
    1.  **Event Schema Definition**: Define and register event schemas in Schema Registry.
    2.  **Event Pattern Matching**: Define precise event patterns in rules to minimize unnecessary target invocations.
    3.  **Archive & Replay**: Enable archiving for critical events to allow event replay for recovery.
    4.  **DLQ per Target**: Configure DLQ (SQS Standard) per target to capture delivery failures.
    5.  **Cross-Account Event Bus**: Use cross-account event buses for microservice event coupling elimination.
    6.  **Scheduler**: Use EventBridge Scheduler for recurring tasks (cron/rate). Recommended over Lambda cron jobs.

### Rule 17.4: The Idempotency Mandate
-   **Law**: All message consumers MUST be designed as **idempotent**. In distributed systems with at-least-once delivery, designing for duplicate message processing is mandatory.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Idempotency Key**: Record processed message IDs in DynamoDB/Redis to prevent duplicate processing.
    2.  **Powertools**: Recommend adopting the AWS Lambda Powertools Idempotency module.
    3.  **Conditional Writes**: Use conditional writes for DB updates (DynamoDB ConditionExpression, RDB Optimistic Locking).

    ```python
    # Lambda Powertools Idempotency implementation example
    from aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.idempotency import (
        DynamoDBPersistenceLayer, idempotent
    )

    persistence = DynamoDBPersistenceLayer(table_name="IdempotencyTable")

    @idempotent(persistence_store=persistence)
    def handler(event, context):
        # This function executes only once per unique event
        payment_id = event["detail"]["payment_id"]
        return process_payment(payment_id)
    ```

    1.  **Per-Resource CO2 Visibility**: Estimate and visualize CO2 emissions per AWS resource (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.). Data-driven identification of which services/Regions have the highest environmental impact.
    2.  **Optimization Recommendations**: Green Insights proposes specific sustainability improvement actions. Examples: estimated CO2 reduction from Graviton migration, quantified effects of off-peak scale-down, renewable energy ratio improvement from Region changes.
    3.  **Sustainability KPI Dashboard**: Integrate Green Insights metrics into CloudWatch custom dashboards. Track monthly CO2 emission reductions. Quantitatively manage sustainability goal progress.
    4.  **Reporting**: Export data from Green Insights for ESG reports and sustainability reports. Periodic review of Scope 1/2/3 emissions.
    5.  **AWS 2025 Achievement**: AWS achieved 100% renewable energy for business operations in 2025. Consider this when selecting Regions.
-   **vs Customer Carbon Footprint Tool**: Green Insights = per-resource detailed analysis + improvement recommendations. CCFT = account-wide macro indicators. Use both.

## 153. AWS Shield AI-Driven Threat Detection (AI-Enhanced DDoS Protection)

### Rule 153.1: The Shield AI-Driven Protection Protocol
-   **Law**: Leverage **AWS Shield**'s AI-driven threat detection for advanced DDoS protection, auto-detecting and mitigating sophisticated DDoS attacks that traditional rule-based detection cannot address (2025 enhancement).
-   **Action**:
    1.  **AI Detection Model**: Shield Advanced learns traffic pattern baselines via ML models, automatically distinguishing between normal traffic increases (campaigns, etc.) and DDoS attacks. Significant false positive reduction.
    2.  **Automatic Mitigation**: AI auto-generates and applies optimal mitigation rules for detected attacks. Response time reduced to seconds.
    3.  **L7 Application DDoS**: High-accuracy detection of HTTP/HTTPS application-layer attacks (Slowloris, HTTP Flood, etc.). Automatic WAF rule adjustment.
    4.  **Shield Response Team (SRT) Integration**: Combine Shield Advanced SRT support with AI detection for immediate expert assistance during large-scale attacks.
    5.  **Cost Protection**: Shield Advanced DDoS Cost Protection automatically covers scaling costs caused by DDoS attacks.

## 154. Billing Custom Views & Split Cost Allocation (Advanced Cost Governance)

### Rule 154.1: The Advanced Cost Governance Protocol
-   **Law**: Build team/project-specific cost views with **AWS Billing Custom Views** and fairly split shared resource costs using **Split Cost Allocation Data** for cost visibility and accurate allocation.
-   **Action**:
    1.  **Billing Custom Views (2025 GA)**: Create dedicated cost views with custom filters, groupings, and calculated fields beyond standard Cost Explorer preset views. Build per-team cost dashboards.
    2.  **Split Cost Allocation Data**: Split costs of multi-tenant shared resources (EKS clusters, ElastiCache clusters, ECS shared services, etc.) by tenant/team/project based on actual usage (CPU/memory/storage consumption).
    3.  **Chargeback/Showback**: Provide accurate cost allocation reports to each team using Split Cost data. Choose between chargeback (actual billing) or showback (informational display) operating models.
    4.  **FinOps Integration**: Define and track FinOps Foundation-recommended Unit Economics (per-user cost, per-transaction cost) in Custom Views.
    5.  **Alert Integration**: Set Budget Alarms based on Custom Views for per-team budget overrun detection and notification.
-   **Cross-Ref**: FinOps basics in §9. Cost anomaly detection in §74. Database Savings Plans in §112. RI/SP strategy in §9.2.

## 155. AWS Cloud Maturity Model & Anti-Patterns (Maturity Model & Anti-Patterns)

### Rule 155.1: The AWS Cloud Maturity Model
-   **Law**: Evaluate your organization's AWS cloud adoption level using the following **5-level maturity model** and systematically plan improvements to the next level.
-   **Maturity Levels**:

    | Level | Name | Characteristics |
    |:------|:-----|:----------------|
    | L1 | **Ad-hoc** | Console-centric operations, no IaC, no tags, no cost management, reactive security |
    | L2 | **Foundational** | IaC adoption started, basic security (GuardDuty/Config enabled), cost visibility, single account |
    | L3 | **Systematic** | Multi-account strategy, CI/CD pipelines, regular Well-Architected reviews, FinOps practice, auto-remediation started |
    | L4 | **Advanced** | Data Perimeter built, regular chaos engineering, AI/ML integration, Observability as Code, automated maturity metrics |
    | L5 | **Optimized** | Fully automated IaC, AI-driven operations (DevOps Agent/AIOps), FinOps culture established, Sustainability KPI tracking, Continuous Compliance |

-   **Action**: Conduct quarterly maturity self-assessments. Avoid skipping 2+ levels — progress systematically to the next level.

### Rule 155.2: The AWS Anti-Pattern Catalog (20 Critical Anti-Patterns)
-   **Law**: Recognize the following anti-patterns and immediately remediate when detected in projects.

    | # | Anti-Pattern | Risk | Correct Approach |

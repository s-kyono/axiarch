## Part I: Philosophy & Core Principles 🌐

### §1. Primary Directive — Web Frontend Excellence

- **Rule 33.1**: The frontend is the business frontline. Performance degradation, accessibility deficiency, and security flaws directly and immediately impact business
- **Priority**: Security > Performance > Accessibility > UX > Maintainability > Development Speed
- **Zero Compromise**: Core Web Vitals (LCP ≤ 2.5s / INP ≤ 200ms / CLS ≤ 0.1) are "deployment gates," not mere "goals"
- **Latest Stable**: Always assume the latest stable version of frameworks and libraries. New usage of deprecated APIs is prohibited
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript Strict mode is mandatory. Usage of the `any` type is prohibited in principle
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimize user data collection and prioritize server-side processing

### §2. Architecture Principles

- **Rule 33.2**: Server First — Data fetching and business logic execute server-side. Only minimal interactive functionality on the client
- **Rule 33.3**: Composition over Inheritance — Design components through composition, not inheritance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Aim for core content to be viewable even with JavaScript disabled
- **Defensive Programming**: Distrust all external input (API, URL Params, User Input) and enforce validation at boundaries
- **Fail Fast**: Missing environment variables or type inconsistencies should crash at startup, physically preventing inexplicable behavior in production

### §3. Universal Principles vs Framework-Specific

- **Rule 33.4**: This rule encompasses both "Universal Web Frontend Principles (🌐)" and "Next.js / React-Specific Best Practices (⚛️)." The scope icon at the beginning of each Part clarifies the applicable scope
- **Framework Agnostic (🌐)**: CWV optimization, CSS design, A11y, SEO, Security, etc. are universal rules independent of any specific framework
- **Framework Specific (⚛️)**: RSC, App Router, React Hooks, Server Actions, etc. are rules specific to Next.js/React
- **Hybrid (🔀)**: Principles are universal, but code snippets and specific implementations target React/Next.js
- **Cross-Reference**: `engineering/000_engineering_standards.md`, `design/000_design_ux.md`

> [!TIP]
> **Application Guide for Non-React Projects**
> While this rule primarily targets React/Next.js, 🌐-scoped Parts can be applied as-is to **any web frontend technology stack** (Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit, Astro, Vanilla JS, etc.).
> List of 🌐 Parts that can be independently used for non-React projects:
> Part I (Philosophy) / VII (CSS) / XIV (Input UX) / XV (Security) / XVIII (Performance) / XX–XXI (SEO/GEO) / XXII (A11y) / XXIII (PWA) / XXIV (i18n) / XXVIII (AdTech) / XXXI (Web Platform API) / XXXII (Observability) / XXXIV (Micro-Frontend) / XXXV (Web Worker) / XXXVI (Security Deep Dive) / XXXVII (FinOps) / XXXVIII (Design System) / XXXIX (Anti-Patterns) / XLI (Real-Time Communication) / XLIII (Animation) / XLIV (Responsive) / XLVII (Third-Party Scripts) / XLVIII (Sustainability) / XLIX (Maturity Model)

## Part II: Technology Stack Standards ⚛️

### §4. Recommended Technology Stack

| Layer | Standard Technology | Notes |
|:------|:-------------------|:------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 16+ (App Router) | Pages Router for legacy maintenance only |
| **UI Library** | React 19.2+ | Server Components standard |
| **Language** | TypeScript 5.x (Strict) | JavaScript is prohibited |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4+ / shadcn/ui | Design Token management required |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + Zod | Schema-Driven Development |
| **State Management** | Server State: RSC / Client: Zustand or Jotai | Redux is prohibited for new projects |
| **Testing** | Vitest + Playwright + Storybook | Testing Trophy compliant |
| **Linting** | ESLint (Flat Config) + Prettier / Biome | Zero Warnings required |
| **Build** | Turbopack (Next.js 16 default) + FS Caching | Webpack for legacy maintenance only |
| **Package Manager** | pnpm recommended | Lockfile commit required |

### §5. Version Management & Dependencies

- **Rule 33.5**: Use Caret Range (`"react": "^19.1.0"`) for `package.json` dependencies to automatically acquire patch/minor updates. However, **lockfile commits are mandatory**
- **Renovate/Dependabot**: Enable automated dependency update PRs and merge after a 21-day stabilization period
- **The Freshness Obligation**: External service SDKs (AI, Auth, Payment, etc.) evolve rapidly. Always use the latest version for new implementations, and "update first" as the primary resolution strategy when issues arise
- **Cross-Reference**: `security/200_oss_compliance.md`
- **Next.js 16 Breaking Changes**: Upgrading to Next.js 16 requires Node.js 20.9+ and TypeScript 5+. AMP support has been removed. `middleware.ts` is replaced by `proxy.ts` (see Part LI for details)

### §301. Tailwind CSS 4 Deep Dive

- **Rule 33.294**: Understand and maximize Tailwind CSS 4's new architecture
- **CSS-First Configuration**: Migrate from `tailwind.config.ts` to CSS-native `@theme` directive. Complete all configuration within CSS
- **Oxide Engine**: Rust-powered engine delivers up to 10x faster build speeds. Combined with Turbopack for dramatically improved DX
- **`@layer` Integration**: Tailwind v4 natively leverages CSS `@layer`. Manages utilities, components, and base in three native layers
- **Lightning CSS**: Reduces PostCSS dependency, leveraging Lightning CSS for native CSS transpilation
- **Zero-Config Content Detection**: `@source` directive improves automatic content detection accuracy. Manual `content` array configuration is no longer needed

```css
/* ✅ Tailwind CSS 4 — CSS-First Configuration */
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-brand: #6366f1;
  --color-brand-light: #818cf8;
  --font-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;
}
```

---

## Part III: Next.js App Router Architecture ⚛️

### §6. App Router & React Server Components

- **Rule 33.6**: Use the **App Router** as standard and maximize Server Components (RSC) rendering. Dramatically reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client
- **Data Fetching**: Fetch data server-side and avoid waterfalls
- **The Server-Only Import Protocol (Bundle Protection)**:
    - **Rule 33.7**: Files exclusive to the server (`lib/api/*`, `lib/actions/*`, etc.) must include `import 'server-only'`
    - **Effect**: Build errors when accidentally imported from Client Components, physically preventing sensitive logic and API key leakage into client bundles

### §7. Directory Ontology

- **`src/app`**: Routing definitions only. Logic prohibited
- **`src/lib/actions`**: Server Actions (data gateways)
- **`src/lib/gateway`**: Data access layer (DB/External APIs)
- **`src/components`**: UI parts. Separate into `ui` (generic) and `features` (feature-specific)
- **`src/hooks`**: Custom hooks
- **`src/types`**: Type definitions & DTOs
- **The Static Page Prohibition (No Hardcoding)**:
    - **Rule 33.8**: Hardcoding content-centric pages (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc.) is prohibited. Deliver from a Headless CMS and handle via dynamic routing
- **The Anti-Haribote UI Protocol (Realism Mandate)**:
    - **Rule 33.9**: UI implementations that treat "future columns" or "ambiguous JSON" not in the DB schema as normalized data are prohibited

### §8. Environment Variable Validation

- **Rule 33.10**: Direct usage of `process.env` is prohibited. Use `t3-env` or `zod` to validate environment variable types and existence at startup. The app must not start if required keys are missing

```typescript
// ✅ Type-safe environment variables with t3-env
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-nextjs";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
    API_SECRET: z.string().min(32),
  },
  client: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    API_SECRET: process.env.API_SECRET,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
  },
});
```

### §9. Site Settings Architecture

- **Runtime Injection**: Retrieve settings like theme colors from the DB at runtime (RootLayout) and inject as CSS variables. Runtime configuration enables design changes without rebuilds

### §10. Next.js 15 Async API Protocol

- **Rule 33.11**: As of Next.js 15, `params`, `searchParams`, `headers`, `cookies`, `draftMode` are Awaitable (Promise)
- **Action**: Always use `await` or React's `use()` hook when referencing these

### §11. Partial Prerendering (PPR)

- **Rule 33.12**: Leverage Next.js 15's Partial Prerendering (PPR) to achieve the optimal combination of static shells and dynamic content
- **Static Shell**: Page layout, navigation, and static content are prerendered as an immediately-delivered static shell
- **Dynamic Streaming**: User-specific content (auth state, personalization, etc.) streams dynamically within `<Suspense>` boundaries
- **Action**: Enable `experimental.ppr: true` in `next.config.ts` and declare `export const experimental_ppr = true` per page
- **Next.js 16 Cache Components**: The `'use cache'` directive reaches GA as the stable version of PPR. Cache boundaries can be declared even within dynamic components

### §302. The next/after API Protocol

- **Rule 33.295**: Leverage Next.js 15+'s `after()` API for non-blocking post-response processing
- **Use Cases**: Logging, analytics event dispatch, cache invalidation, and other side effects that don't affect the response
- **Advantage**: Unlike `waitUntil`, `after()` can be used within Server Actions, Route Handlers, Middleware, and `generateMetadata`
- **Error Isolation**: Errors within `after()` do not affect the main response. However, isolate with `try-catch` to ensure error logging

```typescript
// ✅ Non-blocking logging with next/after
import { after } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await processRequest(request);

  after(async () => {
    await analytics.track('api_call', { endpoint: '/api/data' });
    await auditLog.write({ action: 'data_processed', timestamp: Date.now() });
  });

  return Response.json(data); // Response returned immediately
}
```

## Part IV: Server Components & Client Components ⚛️

### §12. Server / Client Boundary Design

- **Rule 33.13**: Default to Server Component. Apply `'use client'` only to the **smallest unit requiring interactivity**
- **Leaf Component Strategy**: Place `'use client'` at the **leaf (end)** of the component tree. `'use client'` at page or layout level is prohibited
- **Props Serialization**: Props from Server → Client must be serializable values only. Passing functions or class instances is not possible

### §13. The Async-UI Boundary Protocol

- **Rule 33.14**: Directly importing Async Server Components that perform data fetching from UI components (especially Client Components) is prohibited
- **Action**: Components with data logic should render at the top level of `layout.tsx` or `page.tsx` (Server Context) and physically separate from UI using the `children` pattern

### §14. The Component-DTO Interface Protocol

- **Rule 33.15**: Using raw database types (`Row`) in UI component Props definitions is prohibited. Depend on **DTO Interfaces** and hide implementation details

### §15. Production Build Verification Protocol

- **Rule 33.16**: **Code does not "exist" until `npm run build` passes with Exit 0**
- **SSG Awareness**: Importing dynamic APIs like `cookies()` in SSG pages causes production build errors. Separate dynamic dependencies
- **Tiered Database Client Protocol**: SSG/ISR-compatible DB clients must be **physically separated into different files** based on dynamic API dependency vs non-dependency

---

## Part V: Edge Computing & Middleware ⚛️

### §16. Edge Middleware Design

- **Rule 33.17**: Execute authentication checks and geolocation redirects in **Edge Middleware** to minimize latency
- **Rule 33.18**: Keep `middleware.ts` lightweight and exclude static assets from processing scope. Heavy DB queries or external API calls within Middleware are prohibited

### §17. The Non-Blocking Edge Processing Protocol

- **Rule 33.19**: Blocking DB writes unrelated to the main response with `await` in Edge Middleware and API Routes is prohibited
- **waitUntil**: Background side effects using `event.waitUntil()`
- **Error Isolation**: Isolate background processing errors with try-catch

### §18. CSP Worker Integrity

- **Rule 33.20**: Libraries like `heic2any` internally create `Web Workers` and use `blob:` URLs. Explicitly include `worker-src 'self' blob:;` in Middleware CSP settings

---

## Part VI: UI Component Design 🔀

### §19. shadcn/ui + Design Tokens

- **Rule 33.21**: Adopt **shadcn/ui** as the standard UI component library, balancing customizability and accessibility
- **Design Token**: Define project-specific colors, fonts, and shadows as tokens in Tailwind Config's `extend`. Direct HEX value usage is prohibited
- **Class Sorting**: Usage of `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` is mandatory

### §20. Interactive Components Standard

- **Rich Selection Protocol**: Conventional Radio/Checkbox is prohibited in principle. **"Intuitively clickable rich card-style UI"** is the standard
- **Responsive Combobox Protocol**: Desktop: `Popover` / Mobile: **Drawer (Vaul)**
- **Stable IDs**: `CommandItem` `value` must be a unique, consistent **ASCII string**. Using Japanese in `value` breaks selection logic

### §21. The Design Consistency Protocol

- **Rule 33.22**: System-native `<input type="date">` is prohibited as it breaks design system consistency as a "foreign element"
- **The App-Like Feel Protocol (Overscroll Control)**: Apply `overscroll-behavior-y: none` for mobile web apps is recommended

### §22. The Performance First Protocol

- **Rule 33.23**: Core Web Vitals are deployment requirements, not mere goals
    - **LCP < 2.5s**, **INP < 200ms**, **CLS < 0.1**
- **Bundle Size SLA**: Initial JS must stay under **150KB (Gzipped)**
- **Rule 33.24**: Libraries exceeding **30KB** Gzip in the main bundle are prohibited. Code Split with `next/dynamic`

### §23. The Canonical Identity Protocol

- **Rule 33.25**: On public pages, always define `alternates: { canonical: url }` in `generateMetadata`

### §24. Media Interaction (Crop UI)

- **Rule 33.26**: Automatic server-side cropping is prohibited. Implement UI allowing users to determine trimming range
- **HEIC Conversion**: Automatically convert iPhone `.HEIC` to JPEG/PNG with `heic2any` before upload
- **Filename Sanitization**: Convert multi-byte filenames to romanized characters on the client side

---

## Part VII: CSS Architecture 🌐

### §25. Utility First CSS

- **Rule 33.27**: Use Tailwind Utility classes as the standard
- **Component Extraction**: Encapsulate common patterns as React components and avoid `@apply` as much as possible
- **CSS Modules**: Only permitted for complex animations or styles that are difficult to express with Tailwind

### §26. The CSS Specificity Protocol

- **Rule 33.28**: Overriding styles with `!important` is **completely prohibited**. Resolve root causes or control through React state management

### §27. The CSS Class Merge Utility Protocol

- **Rule 33.29**: Manual concatenation with template literals or string concatenation is prohibited. Mandate dedicated merge utilities: `cn()` / `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`

### §28. The Z-Index Stratification Protocol

- **Rule 33.30**: Prevent Z-Index "magic numbers"

| Layer | Z-Index | Target |
|:------|:--------|:-------|
| **Overlay** | 10000 | `Select`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `Calendar` |
| **Modal** | 9999 | `Dialog`, `Sheet` |
| **Menu** | 1000 | Drawer menu, Navigation |
| **Header** | 50 | Fixed header |
| **Floaters** | 40 | Floating buttons |

### §29. The Stacking Context Safety Protocol

- **Rule 33.31**: Applying explicit `z-index` to regular content elements is prohibited in principle. Isolate scope with `isolation: isolate`

### §30. The CSS Containment Protocol

- **Rule 33.32**: Apply `contain: layout` to scroll containers to isolate layout calculation scope
- **The Natural Scrolling Protocol**: Nested scroll structure using `h-dvh` + `overflow-y-auto` is prohibited. Delegate to browser-native Window Scroll with `min-h-dvh`

### §31. Container Queries

- **Rule 33.33**: Use **CSS Container Queries** (`@container`) for component-level responsive control. Media queries (`@media`) are viewport-dependent and unsuitable for autonomous responsive design of reusable components
- **Container Type**: Set `container-type: inline-size` on parent elements requiring responsive control
- **Container Units**: Leverage container query units (`cqw`, `cqi`, etc.) for components to flexibly adjust layout based on their container size

```css
/* ✅ Component-autonomous responsive with Container Query */
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; }
}
@container (max-width: 399px) {
  .card { display: flex; flex-direction: column; }
}
```

### §303. The CSS Layers (`@layer`) Protocol

- **Rule 33.296**: Leverage **CSS Cascade Layers** (`@layer`) to control style priority at the cascade level
- **Layer Order**: Layer declaration order determines cascade priority. Later declared layers take precedence
- **Third-Party Isolation**: Isolate third-party CSS in dedicated layers to prevent conflicts with project styles
- **Tailwind CSS 4 Integration**: Tailwind v4 internally uses `@layer base`, `@layer components`, `@layer utilities`. Understand integration with custom layers
- **Unlayered Styles**: Styles not belonging to any layer take precedence over all layers. Recommend placing all styles in layers to prevent unintended overrides

```css
/* ✅ Priority control with CSS Layers */
@layer reset, third-party, base, components, utilities;

@layer reset {
  *, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; }
}
@layer third-party {
  /* Isolate third-party library styles here */
}
@layer components {
  .card { border-radius: var(--radius); padding: 1rem; }
}
```

### §304. The CSS `:has()` Selector Protocol

- **Rule 33.297**: Leverage CSS `:has()` selector (parent selector) for styling based on child element state without JavaScript
- **Form Validation Styling**: Style entire form groups' error state with `:has(:invalid)`
- **Interactive States**: Change container styles when focused with `:has(:focus-within)`
- **Layout Adaptation**: Auto-adjust card layout for image-containing cards with `:has(> img)`
- **Performance Note**: `:has()` can be a high-cost selector. Avoid complex nesting. Rely on browser optimizations while verifying through measurement

```css
/* ✅ Declarative styling with :has() */
.form-group:has(:invalid) {
  border-color: var(--color-destructive);
}
.card:has(> img) {
  grid-template-rows: 200px 1fr;
}
.sidebar:has(~ main:empty) {
  display: none;
}
```

## Part VIII: Component Design Principles 🔀

### §32. The Component Colocation Protocol

- **Rule 33.34**: "Sub-components," "type definitions," and "constants" used only in a specific component should be written in the **same file (Co-location)**. Splitting is only permitted when a file exceeds **300 lines**

### §33. The Barrel Export Prohibition

- **Rule 33.35**: Bulk re-export through `index.ts` (Barrel files) is prohibited. Direct imports from physical files are mandatory

### §34. The Dead Code Execution Protocol

- **Rule 33.36**: Do not place heavy imports "after" conditional branches or early returns

### §35. The Static Component Persistence Protocol

- **Rule 33.37**: Defining components inside another component's render function is prohibited. Sub-components must be defined at **Module Scope (file top level)**
- **Anti-Pattern**: `const MyComponent = () => { const Sub = () => <div />; return <Sub />; }` — **Technical Felony**

### §36. The Route Conflict Ban

- **Rule 33.38**: When refactoring pages, physically delete the source directory

---

## Part IX: React Hooks Best Practices ⚛️

### §37. The React Hooks Order Guarantee Protocol

- **Rule 33.39**: Hooks call order must be invariant across renders
- **Mandatory Order (Axiarch Standard)**:
    1. **ALL HOOKS FIRST**: Aggregate all Hooks at the component top
    2. **DERIVED STATE**: Variable calculations & state derivations
    3. **CONDITIONAL RETURNS**: Early Return

### §38. The Hook Dependency Protocol

- **Rule 33.40**: `useEffect` / `useCallback` dependency arrays must strictly follow ESLint (`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`). Removing dependencies "because of infinite loops" is strictly prohibited

### §39. The Reactive Subscription Safety Protocol

- **Rule 33.41**: Directly including return values of `watch()`, `subscribe()`, etc. in `useEffect` dependency arrays is prohibited. Use the Callback Subscription Pattern

### §40. The Subscription Timer Sanitization Protocol

- **Rule 33.42**: `setTimeout` / `setInterval` within subscription callbacks must manage timer IDs with `useRef`. Managing timers with local variables is prohibited

### §41. The Explicit Initial State Typing Mandate

- **Rule 33.43**: When passing `[]` or `null` to `useState`, explicit generic type parameters are mandatory
- `useState([])` prohibited → `useState<Item[]>([])`
- `useState(null)` prohibited → `useState<User | null>(null)`

### §42. The Compiler Readiness Protocol

- **Rule 33.44**: Promote React Compiler-compatible coding patterns. Avoid excessive manual use of `useMemo` / `useCallback` and implement components as pure functions

---

## Part X: React 19 New APIs & React Compiler ⚛️

### §43. React 19 Actions

- **Rule 33.45**: Leverage React 19's Actions concept to handle data mutations with async functions wrapped in `startTransition`
- **Automatic Pending State**: Actions automatically manage `isPending` state, reducing manual `isLoading` state management
- **Error Handling**: Errors within Actions are automatically caught by Error Boundary or `useActionState` error state

### §44. useOptimistic

- **Rule 33.46**: Use the `useOptimistic` hook to implement optimistic UI updates that instantly update UI before server response
- **Low-Risk Operations**: Limit to reversible operations like like buttons, comment additions, etc. Wait for server confirmation for high-risk operations like payments
- **Automatic Rollback**: UI automatically rolls back to original state on server operation failure
- **Pure Update Function**: The function calculating optimistic state must be a pure function

### §45. useFormStatus & useActionState

- **Rule 33.47**: Use `useFormStatus` for form submission state management, automatically controlling button `disabled` / `loading` states
- **Scoping**: `useFormStatus` is scoped to the parent `<form>` element. Cannot obtain the state of a different form in the same component
- **useActionState**: Use `useActionState` as the successor to `useFormState` to manage Action pending state, return values, and errors in an integrated manner

### §46. use() Hook

- **Rule 33.48**: Use the `use()` hook to directly consume Promises and Contexts within Suspense boundaries
- **Data Fetching**: When passing data from Server Components to Client Components, use the pattern of passing Promises as props and resolving with `use()`
- **Conditional Invocation**: `use()` is the only hook that permits invocation within conditional branches, unlike other Hooks

### §47. React Compiler v1.0

- **Rule 33.49**: Introduce React Compiler (v1.0 GA, October 2025 / stable integration in Next.js 16) and **completely remove** manual `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `React.memo`
- **Automatic Memoization**: The compiler performs automatic memoization of components and hooks. Manual optimization is generally unnecessary and **discouraged**
- **Compatibility Mode**: Use `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` for pre-validation of compiler compatibility during gradual adoption
- **Pure Component Requirement**: Components must be pure functions (same input produces same output) as a prerequisite for compiler optimization
- **Next.js 16 Integration**: Set `experimental.reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts` (enabled by default in Next.js 16)

### §48. Resource Preloading API

- **Rule 33.50**: Leverage React 19's `preload()`, `preinit()`, `prefetchDNS()`, `preconnect()` APIs to programmatically control resource preloading
- **Font Preloading**: Pre-initialize critical fonts with `preinit()`
- **Third-Party DNS**: Minimize DNS resolution time with `prefetchDNS()` for external services

### §48b. useEffectEvent Hook

- **Rule 33.304**: Leverage the `useEffectEvent` hook stabilized in React 19.2 to separate non-reactive logic from Effects
- **Problem**: Logic that needs the latest value but should not be in the `useEffect` dependency array (e.g., referencing latest state during logging)
- **Solution**: Define non-reactive functions with `useEffectEvent` and call them from within Effects. This fundamentally resolves dependency array bloat and stale closure issues
- **Prohibition**: Functions defined with `useEffectEvent` must NOT be passed to other components or hooks. Use only within Effects

```typescript
// ✅ Non-reactive logic separation with useEffectEvent
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }: Props) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent((connectedRoomId: string) => {
    // theme references the latest value but is NOT needed in Effect dependencies
    showNotification(`Connected to ${connectedRoomId}`, theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => onConnected(roomId));
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // theme is NOT needed in the dependency array
}
```

### §305. React Activity Component

- **Rule 33.298**: Leverage the `<Activity>` component promoted to GA in React 19.2 to preserve state of hidden components while removing them from the DOM
- **Mode**: `mode="visible"` for normal display, `mode="hidden"` to remove from DOM while preserving state
- **Use Cases**:
    - Preserving input form state during tab switches
    - Pre-rendering modals/drawers
    - Retaining background pages during route transitions
- **Priority**: Hidden components render at low priority, minimizing main thread impact
- **Status**: React 19.2 GA — Fully supported in Next.js 16. Adopt proactively

```tsx
// ✅ State-preserving tab UI with Activity
import { Activity } from 'react';

function TabPanel({ activeTab }: { activeTab: string }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'edit' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <EditForm /> {/* Form state preserved when hidden */}
      </Activity>
      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'preview' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <Preview />
      </Activity>
    </>
  );
}
```

### §306. React `<ViewTransition>` GA Integration

- **Rule 33.299**: Leverage React's `<ViewTransition>` component (GA version) for declarative route transition and UI state change animations
- **Declarative API**: Integrates with `startTransition` to automatically trigger View Transitions API within React's update cycle
- **Cross-Document**: Recommended to enable automatic View Transition application for Next.js App Router cross-page navigation
- **CSS Customization**: Fine-grained animation control via `::view-transition-group()`, `::view-transition-old()`, `::view-transition-new()` pseudo-elements
- **Fallback**: Falls back to normal DOM updates on browsers that don't support View Transitions API (progressive enhancement)

```tsx
// ✅ Route transition animation with ViewTransition
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

function NavigationLink({ href, children }: Props) {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <ViewTransition>
      <a onClick={() => startTransition(() => router.push(href))}>
        {children}
      </a>
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

### §305b. cacheSignal() API

- **Rule 33.325**: Leverage the `cacheSignal()` API introduced in React 19.2 for precise control over RSC (React Server Components) cache lifecycles
- **Purpose**: Provides an `AbortSignal` linked to the cache entry's lifetime generated by the `cache()` API. Automatically cancels in-progress async operations (fetch, DB connections, etc.) when the cache is invalidated
- **Use Case**: Prevention of resource leaks from long-running data fetches and external API calls
- **Integration**: Pass `cacheSignal()` to the `signal` option of `fetch` to coordinate cache lifetime with HTTP requests

```typescript
// ✅ Cache-linked cancellation with cacheSignal()
import { cache } from 'react';
import { cacheSignal } from 'react';

const getProduct = cache(async (id: string) => {
  const signal = cacheSignal();
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/products/${id}`, { signal });
  // When cache is invalidated, signal is aborted, automatically canceling unnecessary requests
  return res.json();
});
```

### §305c. React Performance Tracks (Chrome DevTools)

- **Rule 33.326**: Leverage **Performance Tracks** introduced in React 19.2 to visualize React's scheduler behavior and component rendering in Chrome DevTools' Performance panel
- **Feature**: Dedicated tracks with component names are displayed in DevTools, enabling visual understanding of rendering times, re-render causes, and Suspense boundary resolution timing
- **INP Debugging**: Track React's response path to user interactions to identify root causes of INP degradation
- **Status**: Enabled by default in Chrome 131+. Use alongside React DevTools Profiler for both Lab Data and Field Data analysis

### §305d. Batching Suspense Boundaries for SSR

- **Rule 33.327**: Understand the **SSR Suspense boundary batch processing** improvement in React 19.2 to enhance SSR streaming consistency
- **Behavior**: When multiple Suspense boundaries can resolve simultaneously, content is displayed in a consistent order between client and server. Animation and layout shift consistency is improved
- **Impact**: Suspense boundary placement design improves users' perceived load speed and CLS. Overly granular boundary splits reduce the batching effect, so setting boundaries at meaningful units is recommended

---

## Part XI: Hydration & SSR Stability ⚛️

### §49. The Hydration Stability Protocol
- **Rule 33.51**: Minimize the risk of output mismatches between SSR and client rendering (Hydration Mismatch)
- **Root Cause**: Using `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, browser-specific globals (`window.innerWidth`, etc.) during SSR causes mismatches
- **Suppress**: `suppressHydrationWarning` is **only permitted for date/time display**. Usage for anything else is prohibited

### §50. The SSR Stream Resilience Protocol
- **Rule 33.52**: Implement strict null guards for data access during SSR streaming. Property access without null checks is prohibited
- **Debug Protocol**: Debug SSR errors via **server terminal output**, not browser DevTools

### §51. The Server Cookie Write Authority Protocol
- **Rule 33.53**: Cookie writes are limited to **Server Actions** or **Route Handlers**. Cookie writes during SSR (`page.tsx` rendering) are not possible

### §52. The Component Config Re-mount Protocol
- **Rule 33.54**: When component internal state reset is needed on dynamic configuration changes (theme, locale, etc.), include the configuration value in the React `key` prop to force re-mount

### §53. The Hydration-Safe Dynamic Content
- **Rule 33.55**: Client-only content (`window.location`, browser-specific values, etc.) should use the `useEffect` + state pattern for deferred rendering, returning `null` or fallback during SSR

---

## Part XII: Form Design (React Hook Form + Zod) 🔀

### §54. Schema-Driven Development
- **Rule 33.56**: Form design starts with Zod schema. Guarantee **Three-Point Sync** (Type, Validation, UI synchronization)
- **Three-Point Sync**: Schema (Zod) + DefaultValues + UI must always be aligned

### §55. The Form DefaultValues Completeness Mandate
- **Rule 33.57**: Explicitly set initial values for all fields in `useForm({ defaultValues })`. Implicit `undefined` dependency on undefined fields is prohibited

### §56. The Validation Error Transparency Mandate
- **Rule 33.58**: In addition to `handleSubmit(onValid)`, always implement the `onInvalid` callback: `handleSubmit(onValid, onInvalid)`
- Log Zod validation error details with `console.error` to prevent silent submission failures

### §57. The Strict Action Return Type
- **Rule 33.59**: Server Action return values must use a strict Union Type like **`ActionResult<T>`**

```typescript
type ActionResult<T> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: string; fieldErrors?: Record<string, string[]> };
```

### §58. Server Action Form Integration
- **Rule 33.60**: After form submission, invalidate related caches with `revalidatePath` / `revalidateTag` to ensure UI and server state synchronization

### §59. Reset Form Protocol
- **Rule 33.61**: Use `form.reset()` for post-submission reset. When updating `defaultValues`, explicitly overwrite with `reset(newValues)`

### §60. Multi-Step Form Protocol
- **Rule 33.62**: Define individual Zod schemas per step in multi-step forms and execute validation on step transitions. Perform integrated validation of all step data at final submission

---

## Part XIII: Advanced Form Patterns 🔀

### §61. The Atomic Tabbed Form Protocol
- **Rule 33.63**: Split large forms (15+ fields) into tabs to reduce cognitive load
- **Tab Validation**: Validate only current tab fields on tab switch

### §62. The Auto-Save & Data Persistence Protocol
- **Rule 33.64**: Implement auto-save for important forms (profile editing, post creation, etc.)
- **Debounce**: Execute auto-save after 500ms–1000ms debounce after change detection
- **Visual Feedback**: Always display save state ("Saving..." / "Saved ✓")
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detect simultaneous editing across tabs/devices using Optimistic Locking (`updatedAt` comparison)

### §63. The Dynamic Form Engine Protocol
- **Rule 33.65**: Dynamic form generation (admin panels, etc.) should render fields schema-driven

### §64. The useFieldArray Initialization Guard
- **Rule 33.66**: Watching `useFieldArray` `fields` in useEffect and calling `append` / `replace` causes infinite loops
- **Pattern**: Guard with `fields.length === 0` condition + `useRef` flag for one-time execution

### §65. The One-Shot Initialization Guard Protocol
- **Rule 33.67**: Dynamic array (`useFieldArray`) initialization must execute strictly once using the `useRef` flag pattern

### §66. The DnD Overlay Input Isolation Protocol
- **Rule 33.68**: Placing form input fields inside Drag & Drop overlays is prohibited. `DragOverlay` rendering must be limited to read-only previews

---

## Part XIV: Input UX Optimization 🌐

### §67. The Input Mode Mandate
- **Rule 33.69**: Set appropriate `inputMode` attributes for mobile keyboard optimization
    - Numeric input → `inputMode="numeric"`
    - Phone number → `inputMode="tel"`
    - Email → `inputMode="email"`
    - URL → `inputMode="url"`

### §68. The Input Normalization Protocol (NFKC)
- **Rule 33.70**: Convert full-width alphanumeric user input to half-width (NFKC normalization) before server submission. Japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji) are excluded from NFKC conversion

### §69. The IME Composition Guard
- **Rule 33.71**: Prevent form submission from firing on Enter key press before IME input is confirmed (during composition). Guard with `compositionstart` / `compositionend` events

### §70. The iOS Input Zoom Defense
- **Rule 33.72**: On iOS, focusing `<input>` with `font-size` below **16px** triggers auto-zoom. Guarantee minimum **16px** font size for mobile input fields

### §71. The External Link Protocol
- **Rule 33.73**: Always add `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external site links

---

## Part XV: Validation & Frontend Security 🌐

### §72. The Anti-Spam Shield
- **Rule 33.74**: Implement Cloudflare Turnstile or reCAPTCHA v3 for public forms (contact, signup, etc.). Combined use with Honeypot fields is recommended

### §73. The Frictionless Security UI Protocol
- **Rule 33.75**: Security measures must not impede user experience. Use Turnstile in invisible mode to maintain user flow

### §74. The Conditional Security Bypass Ban
- **Rule 33.76**: Code that skips authentication checks based on `isAdmin` or `isDev` flags is prohibited. Baseline auth/authorization checks execute on all paths without exception

### §75. The Deep Type Recursion Break Protocol
- **Rule 33.77**: When defining recursive types with Zod or TypeScript, set depth limits with `z.lazy()` or bounded generics. Prevent compilation hangs from infinite recursion

### §76. The Strict DTO Boundary Protocol
- **Rule 33.78**: Receive external data (API Response, URL Params, etc.) as `unknown` type, validate with Zod schema, then cast. `as` type assertions are prohibited

### §77. The URL State Management Protocol
- **Rule 33.79**: Manage UI state for filtering, sorting, pagination via URL SearchParams. `nuqs` library recommended
- **Benefit**: Bookmark sharing, browser history, SSR compatibility

### §78. The Hard Session Refresh Protocol
- **Rule 33.80**: After critical auth state changes (login, logout, permission changes), force refresh with `window.location.reload()`. `router.refresh()` may not fully reset auth context

---

## Part XVI: State Management 🔀

### §79. State Management Philosophy
- **Rule 33.81**: Clarify the state management hierarchy:
    - **Server State**: Managed by RSC / Server Actions / React Query. Frontend only caches
    - **URL State**: Managed by SearchParams (ref §77)
    - **Form State**: Managed by React Hook Form
    - **Client UI State**: Managed by `useState` / Zustand / Jotai
    - **Derived State**: Calculated through derivation. Not held as State
- **Global State Prohibition**: Abuse of global State Stores is prohibited. Manage state at minimum scope

### §80. Zustand / Jotai
- **Rule 33.82**: Use **Zustand** (medium-large stores) or **Jotai** (atomic state) for client-side UI state management
- **Redux Prohibition**: Usage of Redux / Redux Toolkit in new projects is prohibited
- **Immer Integration**: Use `immer` middleware for Zustand nested object updates to write immutable updates concisely

### §81. The Derived State Anti-Pattern
- **Rule 33.83**: The "mirroring pattern" of syncing values calculable from other state with `useState` + `useEffect` is prohibited. Use in-render calculation or `useMemo`

### §82. Context API Usage Criteria
- **Rule 33.84**: React Context should only be used for **data that doesn't update frequently** (theme, auth state). Using Context for frequently updating data (input values, animation state) degrades performance
- **Provider Hell Prevention**: Consider migrating to a state management library when Providers nest 3+ levels

### §83. Persistent State Protocol
- **Rule 33.85**: Implement `localStorage` state persistence with Zustand's `persist` middleware and establish versioning and migration strategies

---

## Part XVII: Data Fetching & Caching ⚛️

### §84. Data Fetching Principles
- **Rule 33.86**: Execute data fetches in Server Components, adhering to:
    1. **Parallel**: Fetch independent data in parallel with `Promise.all`. Waterfalls prohibited
    2. **Suspense**: Manage loading states declaratively with `<Suspense>` boundaries
    3. **Prefetch**: Pre-read data with `<Link prefetch>` for predictable navigation

### §85. The Public Cache Mandate (FinOps Protocol)
- **Rule 33.87**: Cache public read actions (unauthenticated data fetches) with `unstable_cache` (or Next.js 15's `'use cache'` directive)
- **Cache Tags**: Manage cache keys with semantic tags like `['stores', storeId]` and precisely invalidate with `revalidateTag`
- **FinOps Impact**: Public pages without caching result in every access hitting the DB directly, exponentially increasing costs

### §86. The Data Seeding & Cache Versioning Protocol
- **Rule 33.88**: After DB data seeding or migration, update cache version keys to force cache invalidation

### §87. The Resilient RSC Data Access Protocol
- **Rule 33.89**: Null guards are mandatory for data access within RSC. Place `data?.property` or null checks before `data.property`

### §88. React Query Usage Criteria
- **Rule 33.90**: Use **TanStack Query (React Query)** for client-side server state management
- **Stale Time**: Set a global `staleTime` to suppress unnecessary refetches (recommended: 5 minutes)
- **Deduplication**: Concurrent requests with the same key are automatically deduplicated

### §89. DB Query Performance Target
- **Rule 33.91**: DB queries called from the frontend should target **≤ 50ms**. Queries exceeding 100ms require index addition or query optimization

### §90. SWR vs Polling
- **Rule 33.92**: For real-time data updates, select in this priority:
    1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
    2. WebSocket
    3. Polling (last resort, interval ≥ 30 seconds)

---

## Part XVIII: Performance Optimization 🌐

### §91. The CWV Deployment Gate
- **Rule 33.93**: Strictly enforce the following Core Web Vitals thresholds as deployment gates:

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|:-------|:-----|:-------------------|:-----|
| **LCP** | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **INP** | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |

- **Enforcement**: Auto-measure with Lighthouse CI and prohibit merging with `Poor` status

### §92. The Bundle Size Budget
- **Rule 33.94**: Strictly adhere to bundle size budgets:
    - **JS (Gzipped)**: Initial ≤ 150KB, Route Chunk ≤ 50KB
    - **CSS (Gzipped)**: ≤ 30KB
    - **Measurement**: Regular audits with `@next/bundle-analyzer`

### §93. The Dynamic Library Decoupling Protocol
- **Rule 33.95**: Libraries exceeding 30KB (Gzip) are prohibited from main bundle inclusion. Lazy load with `next/dynamic`

### §94. The LCP & Lazy Loading Performance Protocol
- **Rule 33.96**: Above-the-Fold content optimization:
    - Hero images: Apply `priority` attribute. Do not Lazy Load
    - Below-the-Fold images: `loading="lazy"` mandatory
    - `<Suspense>` + Server Component: Progressive display of heavy content via streaming

### §95. The Performance Regression Response
- **Rule 33.97**: Performance degradation response protocol:

| Priority | Condition | Action |
|:---------|:----------|:-------|
| **P0** | LCP > 4s or INP > 500ms | Immediate revert. Prioritize over all tasks |
| **P1** | LCP > 2.5s or INP > 200ms | Fix by next release |
| **P2** | Bundle Size Budget exceeded | Optimize within 2 sprints |

### §96. The Semicolon Guard (ASI Safety)
- **Rule 33.98**: Use semicolons to prevent unexpected behavior from ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion)

### §97. The Baseline Alignment Protocol
- **Rule 33.99**: When labels and form elements don't align at baseline, fix with `items-end` / `items-baseline`

### §98. The Code Input Standard
- **Rule 33.100**: Use syntax-highlighted editor components (Monaco Editor / CodeMirror) for code input fields, not plain `<textarea>`

### §307. The Long Animation Frames (LoAF) API Protocol

- **Rule 33.300**: Leverage the **Long Animation Frames (LoAF) API** to identify root causes of INP degradation
- **vs Long Tasks**: Long Tasks API detects tasks over 50ms but root cause identification is difficult. LoAF provides detailed data including per-script attribution and rendering time
- **Threshold**: Monitor `duration > 100ms`. `blockingDuration` is the metric directly correlated with INP
- **Script Attribution**: Identify causal scripts, execution types (`user-callback`, `event-listener`, `script-block`), and source URLs from the `scripts` array
- **CI Integration**: Integrate with RUM data and set alerts on p75 LoAF Duration degradation

```typescript
// ✅ INP debugging with LoAF API
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.duration > 100) {
      console.warn('Long Animation Frame:', {
        duration: entry.duration,
        blockingDuration: entry.blockingDuration,
        scripts: entry.scripts.map(s => ({
          sourceURL: s.sourceURL,
          invokerType: s.invokerType,
          duration: s.duration,
        })),
      });
    }
  }
});
observer.observe({ type: 'long-animation-frame', buffered: true });
```

### §308. The Scheduler.yield() API Protocol

- **Rule 33.301**: Leverage **`scheduler.yield()`** to avoid prolonged main thread blocking
- **INP Improvement**: Split long tasks with `scheduler.yield()` to ensure the browser has opportunities to respond to user interactions
- **vs setTimeout(0)**: `scheduler.yield()` prioritizes continuation of the main task. `setTimeout(0)` is pushed to the end of the task queue, degrading UX
- **Polyfill**: Cover unsupported browsers with the `scheduler-polyfill` package
- **React Integration**: Recommend combining with React's `startTransition` to schedule low-priority updates

```typescript
// ✅ Main thread release with scheduler.yield()
async function processLargeDataset(items: Item[]) {
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    processItem(items[i]);
    if (i % 100 === 0) {
      await scheduler.yield(); // Release main thread every 100 items
    }
  }
}
```

## Part XIX: Image, Font & Script Optimization 🔀

### §99. The Image Optimization Protocol
- **Rule 33.101**: Use `next/image` (or equivalent optimization component) for images, guaranteeing:
    - Automatic format conversion (WebP / AVIF)
    - Responsive sizes (`sizes` attribute)
    - CLS prevention (`width`/`height` required, or `fill` + wrapper sizing)
    - CDN delivery (Cloudflare Image Transformations, etc.)

### §100. The Image Size Budget

    - Subsetting to minimize file size
    - Preloading critical fonts

### §102. The Script Optimization Protocol
- **Rule 33.103**: Lazy load external scripts (Analytics, Chat Widget, etc.) with `next/script`:
    - **strategy**: `afterInteractive` (default) or `lazyOnload` (non-critical)
    - Scripts impacting CWV require `lazyOnload`

### §103. The AVIF First Protocol
- **Rule 33.104**: Image format priority: **AVIF > WebP > PNG/JPEG**. Set `formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']` in `next/image`

### §104. The SVG Optimization Protocol
- **Rule 33.105**: Optimize SVG icons by removing unnecessary metadata with `svgo`. Use `currentColor` in inline SVGs for theme support

### §105. The Responsive Image Protocol
- **Rule 33.106**: Set `sizes` attributes precisely for responsive images to prevent unnecessary large image downloads. Blanket `sizes="100vw"` is prohibited

---

---

## Part XXI: Technical SEO & GEO 🌐

### §113. The Semantic HTML Landmark Protocol
- **Rule 33.114**: Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) to make page structure explicit
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Maintain logical heading structure without skipping levels: `<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>`
- **Single H1 Rule**: Only **one** `<h1>` per page

### §114. The SSR First Protocol
- **Rule 33.115**: Include critical content in the initial HTML via Server Side Rendering. Content rendered only client-side is recognized by crawlers with delay

    - FAQ structured data + concise answer paragraphs
    - `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` placement
    - E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) enhancement
- **Cross-Reference**: `ai/000_ai_engineering.md`

### §117. The Speculative Rules API Protocol
- **Rule 33.118**: Leverage the **Speculation Rules API** (`<script type="speculationrules">`) for browser-native prerendering and prefetching
- **Prerender**: Apply prerendering to links with high navigation probability (CTAs, main navigation, etc.)
- **Prefetch**: Apply prefetch (resource pre-read only) to uncertain links
- **Eagerness**: `moderate` (on hover or pointerdown) recommended. `eager` (immediate all) requires attention to resource consumption

```html
<script type="speculationrules">
{
  "prerender": [
    { "where": { "href_matches": "/dashboard/*" }, "eagerness": "moderate" }
  ],
  "prefetch": [

### §120. Screen Reader & Icon Labels
- **Rule 33.121**: Verify main flows with screen readers (VoiceOver/TalkBack) on real devices
- **Icon Labels**: Add `aria-label` attributes to icon-only buttons without text to clarify their function

### §121. WAI-ARIA Protocol
- **Rule 33.122**: "No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA." Use native HTML elements wherever possible and keep ARIA attributes minimal

## Part LI: Next.js 16 Migration & New Features ⚛️

### §311. The proxy.ts Migration Protocol

- **Rule 33.305**: In Next.js 16, `middleware.ts` has been replaced by `proxy.ts`. Migrate all projects to `proxy.ts`
- **Runtime**: `proxy.ts` runs on the Node.js runtime (NOT Edge Runtime). All Node.js APIs are available
- **Migration**: Migrate existing `middleware.ts` logic to `proxy.ts`. Request interception, redirects, and header manipulation APIs are now more explicit
- **Breaking**: `NextResponse.next()` → `proxy.next()` change is required

```typescript
// ✅ proxy.ts (Next.js 16)
import { type ProxyRequest } from 'next/server';

export default function proxy(request: ProxyRequest) {
  // Authentication check
  const token = request.cookies.get('session');
  if (!token && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return Response.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
  }

  // Add CSP headers
  const nonce = crypto.randomUUID();
  const headers = new Headers(request.headers);
  headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', `script-src 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'`);
  
  return proxy.next({ headers });
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!_next/static|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

### §312. The `use cache` GA Protocol

- **Rule 33.306**: Leverage the `'use cache'` directive promoted to GA in Next.js 16 for explicit cache control
- **Scope**: Cache can be applied at page, component, or function granularity
- **vs unstable_cache**: Gradual migration from `unstable_cache` to `'use cache'` is recommended. `unstable_cache` is deprecated
- **Tag Management**: Apply cache tags with `cacheTag()` and selectively invalidate with `revalidateTag()`

```typescript
// ✅ 'use cache' directive (Next.js 16 GA)
import { cacheTag, cacheLife } from 'next/cache';

async function getProduct(id: string) {
  'use cache';
  cacheTag(`product-${id}`);
  cacheLife('hours'); // Presets: 'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days' | 'weeks' | 'max'
  
  const product = await db.product.findUnique({ where: { id } });
  return product;
}
```

### §313. Turbopack File System Caching

- **Rule 33.307**: Enable Turbopack's **File System Caching** (Beta) to dramatically reduce startup times for large applications
- **Config**: Set `experimental.turbopackFileSystemCaching: true` in `next.config.ts`
- **Benefit**: Leverage incremental caching for subsequent `next dev` / `next build` runs, reducing startup time by up to 70%
- **Cache Location**: Automatically saved to `.next/cache/turbopack`. CI cache persistence is recommended

### §314. Next.js DevTools MCP Protocol

- **Rule 33.308**: Leverage the **Next.js DevTools MCP** (Model Context Protocol) server for AI-assisted debugging
- **Feature**: Build errors, performance bottlenecks, and routing issues are analyzed by AI assistants with full context awareness
- **Integration**: Integrate with AI-enabled editors (VS Code / Cursor, etc.) to improve development efficiency

### §315. The updateTag API Protocol

- **Rule 33.309**: Leverage Next.js 16's `updateTag()` API to update cache tag values without revalidation
- **vs revalidateTag**: `revalidateTag()` invalidates cache and re-fetches. `updateTag()` directly updates the value, reducing server load
- **Use Case**: Maximize cache efficiency for near-real-time updates (inventory counts, like counts, etc.)

### §316. The Incremental Prefetching Protocol

- **Rule 33.310**: Leverage Next.js 16's **incremental prefetching** for progressive prefetching based on viewport detection and hover triggers
- **Layout Deduplication**: Shared layouts are downloaded only once; only route-specific data is additionally fetched
- **Priority**: Apply `hovering` trigger for CTAs and main navigation; `viewport` trigger for sidebar links

---

## Part LII: GraphQL Frontend Architecture 🌐

### §317. GraphQL Client Standard

- **Rule 33.311**: Use **urql** or **Apollo Client** as the GraphQL client. Select based on the following criteria:
    - **urql**: Lightweight, simple, SSR-friendly. Recommended for small-to-medium projects
    - **Apollo Client**: Advanced caching, local state integration. Recommended for large-scale projects
- **Codegen**: Use `graphql-codegen` to auto-generate type-safe hooks and documents. Manual GraphQL query type definitions are prohibited

### §318. The Fragment Colocation Protocol

- **Rule 33.312**: GraphQL Fragments must be colocated with the component that consumes the data (Fragment Colocation)
- **Benefit**: The data structure required by a component is immediately visible. Prevents residual unnecessary fields
- **Naming**: Fragment names must follow the `ComponentName_fieldName` format

```typescript
// ✅ Fragment Colocation
import { graphql } from '@/gql';

const UserAvatar_user = graphql(`
  fragment UserAvatar_user on User {
    id
    name
    avatarUrl
  }
`);

export function UserAvatar({ user }: { user: FragmentType<typeof UserAvatar_user> }) {
  const data = useFragment(UserAvatar_user, user);
  return <img src={data.avatarUrl} alt={data.name} />;
}
```

### §319. The Persisted Query Protocol

- **Rule 33.313**: Use **Persisted Queries** in production to reduce GraphQL query string network transfer and security risks
- **APQ**: Implement hash-based query identification with Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ)
- **Security**: Reject execution of unregistered queries to prevent GraphQL injection attacks

### §320. The GraphQL Error Handling Protocol

- **Rule 33.314**: GraphQL error handling should assume the "partial success" pattern
- **Partial Data**: When `data` and `errors` are returned simultaneously, display available data while notifying the error
- **Error Classification**: Separate network errors (retry-eligible) from GraphQL errors (business logic errors) in processing

---

## Part LIII: Type-Safe API Client & tRPC 🔀

### §321. tRPC Standard

- **Rule 33.315**: Consider **tRPC** for full-stack TypeScript projects to achieve end-to-end type safety
- **Benefit**: No API schema definition, type generation, or client code generation required. TypeScript types serve directly as the API contract
- **Limitation**: For non-TypeScript clients (mobile apps, etc.), use REST API / GraphQL alongside

### §322. The OpenAPI TypeScript Client Protocol

- **Rule 33.316**: Use `openapi-typescript` + `openapi-fetch` for REST API clients to auto-generate type-safe clients from OpenAPI schemas
- **Codegen**: Integrate type generation into the CI pipeline to automatically detect type mismatches on API schema changes
- **Runtime Validation**: Use Zod for runtime validation of received data (type safety alone is insufficient)

```typescript
// ✅ OpenAPI Type-Safe Client
import createClient from 'openapi-fetch';
import type { paths } from '@/generated/api';

const client = createClient<paths>({ baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL });

// Type-safe API call — path, method, params, and response are all typed
const { data, error } = await client.GET('/api/products/{id}', {
  params: { path: { id: 'prod_123' } },
});
```

### §323. The API Schema Versioning Protocol

- **Rule 33.317**: Implement API schema versioning to clarify the contract between frontend and backend
- **Contract Testing**: Use Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (e.g., Pact) to test the API response structure expected by the frontend
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Automatically detect breaking API schema changes (field removal, type changes, etc.) in CI

### §324. The API Response Normalization Protocol

- **Rule 33.318**: API response normalization is a frontend responsibility, implemented in the DTO transformation layer
- **Adapter Pattern**: Centralize API response → frontend model transformation logic in `api/adapters/`
- **Isolation**: Adapters absorb API response structure changes to prevent propagation to the component layer

---

## Part LIV: Frontend Data Quality & Schema Contract 🌐

### §325. The Frontend Data Quality Gate

- **Rule 33.319**: All external data received by the frontend (API, WebSocket, localStorage, etc.) must be validated with Zod before consumption
- **Trust Boundary**: The frontend's Trust Boundary extends only to "own component's props." All external data is treated as untrusted
- **Error Recovery**: On validation failure, fall back to default values or error state. Must not crash

```typescript
// ✅ External Data Validation Gate
import { z } from 'zod';

const ProductSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  price: z.number().nonnegative(),
  currency: z.enum(['JPY', 'USD', 'EUR']),
  stockCount: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
});

type Product = z.infer<typeof ProductSchema>;

async function fetchProduct(id: string): Promise<Product | null> {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/products/${id}`);
  const json = await res.json();
  const result = ProductSchema.safeParse(json);
  
  if (!result.success) {
    console.error('Product data validation failed:', result.error);
    captureException(result.error); // Send to Sentry
    return null; // Fallback
  }
  return result.data;
}
```

### §326. The Schema Contract Testing Protocol

- **Rule 33.320**: Introduce **schema contract testing** between frontend and backend to detect API structural inconsistencies early
- **Implementation**: Share Zod schema definitions between frontend and backend, testing consistency in CI
- **Monorepo**: Place shared schema packages in `packages/schemas/`

### §327. The Stale Data Detection Protocol

- **Rule 33.321**: Manage cached data freshness to minimize the risk of stale data being presented to users
- **Staleness Indicator**: Display a "Last updated: X minutes ago" indicator for data that has exceeded cache validity
- **Auto-Refresh**: Automatically refresh on tab re-display using the `document.visibilitychange` event

### §328. The Runtime Type Narrowing Protocol

- **Rule 33.322**: Require the Discriminated Union pattern for runtime type narrowing of Union types
- **Discriminant Field**: Narrow types using discriminant fields such as `type` / `kind` / `status`
- **Exhaustive Check**: Implement `never` type checking in the `default` case of `switch` statements (Exhaustive Check) to detect unhandled cases at compile time

```typescript
// ✅ Type-Safe UI Branching with Discriminated Union
type ApiResponse =
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: Product[] }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string };

function ProductList({ response }: { response: ApiResponse }) {
  switch (response.status) {
    case 'loading':
      return <Skeleton />;
    case 'success':
      return <Grid items={response.data} />;
    case 'error':
      return <ErrorMessage message={response.error} />;
    default:
      return response satisfies never; // Compile-time detection of unhandled cases
  }
}
```

### §329. The Data Invariant Protocol

- **Rule 33.323**: Validate business-critical data invariants on the frontend as well
- **Examples**: Stock count ≥ 0, price > 0, start date ≤ end date, total amount = sum of line items
- **Implementation**: Use an `invariant()` utility function for runtime checks, with immediate error reporting on violation

### §330. The Null Object Pattern Protocol

- **Rule 33.324**: Instead of passing `null` for unset DB record fields to components, convert to objects with default values using the **Null Object Pattern**
- **Benefit**: Eliminates null check branching in the component layer, improving code readability and testability
- **DTO Layer**: Generate Null Objects during API → DTO transformation

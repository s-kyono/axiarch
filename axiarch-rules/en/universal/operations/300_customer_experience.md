## Part I: Support Philosophy & Core Principles

### 1.1. The Support-as-Value-Driver Principle
-   **Law**: Position support as a "value driver," not a "cost center."
-   **Metrics Mandate**: Support organization KPIs MUST include the following **3 axes**.

    | Axis | Example Metrics | Purpose |
    |:-----|:---------------|:--------|
    | **Efficiency** | First Response Time, Resolution Time, Deflection Rate, AI Resolution Rate | Operations optimization |
    | **Quality** | CSAT, CES, NPS, QA Score, FCR | User experience assurance |
    | **Business Impact** | Retention Rate, Expansion Revenue, Support-Influenced ARR, Churn Saved Revenue | Revenue contribution visibility |

### 1.2. The Empathy & Efficiency Doctrine
-   **Zappos Style Empowerment**:
    -   Grant support agents authority to resolve issues without manager approval (e.g., refunds up to a set amount, coupon issuance). **Zero runaround** is mandatory.
    -   WOW Experience: Encourage delivery of "WOW" experiences outside the manual (e.g., handwritten messages, anniversary surprises).
-   **First Contact Resolution (FCR) Target**: Aim for FCR rate **≥ 70%**. If FCR is low, suspect insufficient knowledge base, agent training, or empowerment.

### 1.3. The Support-Driven Development Protocol
-   **Law**: Systematically leverage support inquiries as signals for product improvement.
-   **3-Strike Rule**: When the same inquiry occurs **3 times**, automatically create a GitHub Issue and elevate the priority in the development backlog.
-   **Bug Report Fast Track**: Prioritize verification of user-reported bugs, and upon fix completion, always notify the **individual reporter** with a completion notice and thanks.
-   **Product-Support Sync**: Conduct weekly regular meetings between the support and product teams, sharing Top 5 inquiry categories and trend data.

### 1.4. The Effortless Experience Principle
-   **Law**: Minimizing user "Effort" is the greatest driver of loyalty improvement (Gartner CEB research).
-   **Zero Repeat Contact**: Structurally eliminate situations where a user contacts support more than once for the same issue.
-   **Channel Stickiness**: Complete resolution in the channel the user initially chose. Do not force channel switching.
-   **Anticipatory Service**: Detect and proactively resolve issues before the user contacts support (see Part XXIX Proactive Support).
-   **Effort Budget**: Target limiting user actions required for one problem resolution to **5 actions or fewer**.

### 1.5. The Support Excellence Culture
-   **Law**: Support quality is rooted in organizational culture. Institutionalize a company-wide "Customer First" culture.
-   **Executive Support Shadow**: Executives experience support ticket handling at least once per quarter via "Support Shadow Day."
-   **All-Hands Support**: Non-support staff (engineers, PMs, etc.) regularly participate in support handling (recommended: 2 hours/month).
-   **Customer Story Sharing**: Allocate time in all-hands meetings to share support cases (both successes and failures).

## Part II: AI Agent Support Strategy

### 2.1. The AI Triage Protocol
-   **Law**: Classify all inquiries instantly via LLM (technical issue/billing/feature request/bug report) and auto-determine severity (P0-P3).
-   **PII Scrubbing Mandate**: Before forwarding inquiries to AI, mask personal information (names, phone numbers, email addresses) using regex etc., in compliance with `ai/000_ai_engineering.md` PII Scrubbing rules.
-   **Confidence Threshold**: If AI classification confidence is **below 80%**, automatically route to a human agent.
-   **Intent Detection**: Standardize semantic analysis-based intent detection rather than simple keyword matching.
-   **Multi-Intent Handling**: When a single message contains multiple intents (e.g., "billing error and feature request"), separate and process each intent in parallel.

### 2.2. The Agentic AI Support Standard
-   **Law**: Post-2025 AI support must standardize on **Agentic AI architecture capable of autonomously executing tasks and resolving problems**, not simple FAQ bots.
-   **Capability Tiers**:

    | Tier | Capability | Example | Resolution Target |
    |:-----|:----------|:--------|:-----------------|
    | **L1: Information** | Answer questions, provide document links | FAQ responses, knowledge base search | 95% |
    | **L2: Guided Action** | Guide step-by-step operations | Account setting change guidance | 90% |
    | **L3: Delegated Execution** | Execute operations with user permission | Plan changes, refund processing | 85% |
    | **L4: Proactive Intervention** | Initiate contact upon risk detection | Pre-notification on anomaly detection | 80% |
    | **L5: Autonomous Resolution** | Autonomously execute complex workflows | Multi-step problem resolution, API integration | 70% |

-   **Human-in-the-Loop Mandate**: For L3 (Delegated Execution) and above, always obtain **explicit user consent** before execution. AI-initiated billing operations or data changes without consent are strictly prohibited.
-   **Escalation Trigger**: If AI cannot resolve after 3+ exchanges, automatically escalate to a human agent.
-   **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Recommend architecture where multiple specialized AI agents (billing agent, technical agent, account agent) collaborate to resolve complex inquiries.

    -   **Real-time Translation**: Real-time translation support when agent and user speak different languages
-   **Override Principle**: AI Copilot suggestions are "suggestions"; the final decision always rests with the human agent.
-   **Copilot Adoption KPI**: Track Copilot suggestion adoption rate, identify and improve low-adoption categories (target: adoption rate ≥ 60%).

### 2.5. The Conversational AI Design Standard
-   **Law**: AI chatbots and virtual assistants must meet the following quality standards.
-   **Persona Consistency**: Set a persona consistent with brand voice and tone, maintained across all interactions.
-   **Graceful Handoff**: When transitioning from AI to human agent, seamlessly transfer the entire conversation context (including summary). Users must never need to repeat explanations.
-   **Multilingual Support**: Support target market languages with automatic language detection and switching.
-   **Anti-Hallucination**: Prohibit "fabricating" answers from information not in the knowledge base. When uncertain, escalate to human with "Let me look into this."

## Part I. Fundamental Principles & Admin Excellence Culture

### 1.1. Admin Excellence Culture

- **Rule 50.001**: Admin tools and internal tools are "part of the product" and must meet the same quality standards as end-user-facing features
- **Rule 50.002**: Minimizing operator (non-engineer) cognitive load is the top priority
- **Rule 50.003**: Operational errors in admin panels directly lead to customer data corruption. **Structurally preventing misoperations** is mandatory

### 1.2. Priority Hierarchy

```
Security (Data Protection) > Operational Safety (Error Prevention) > Operational Efficiency > Development Speed
```

- All admin tool design decisions must follow this order
- Sacrificing operational safety for development speed is prohibited

### 1.3. Three Admin Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Operator-First** | Design from the operator's perspective. Do not impose engineering convenience |
| **Audit Everything** | Record all operations. Do not allow untraceable operations |
| **Fail Safe** | Default to the safe side in ambiguous states. Require double confirmation for destructive operations |

### 1.4. Admin as a Product

- **Rule 50.004**: Apply product roadmaps, user stories, and sprint planning to admin tools
- Measure operator NPS (Net Promoter Score) quarterly and drive improvement cycles
- Manage admin tool feature requests in a backlog with prioritization

### 1.5. Operator Bill of Rights

| # | Right |
|---|-------|
| 1 | The right to immediately confirm the result of an operation |
| 2 | The right to undo misoperations (Undo / Cooling-off) |
| 3 | The right to understand operations without technical jargon |
| 4 | The right to verify that operations are correctly recorded in audit logs |
| 5 | The right to practice operations in a safe environment (sandbox) |
| 6 | The right to know system state changes in real-time |
| 7 | The right to preview the impact scope before executing operations (Blast Radius Preview) |

### 1.6. Platform Thinking

- **Rule 50.005**: Design admin tools as an "operational platform," not just a collection of screens
- Adopt extensibility (Plugins), self-service, and API-First as foundational principles
- Position operators as "platform customers" and build feedback loops

---

## Part II. Build vs Buy Strategy

### 2.1. Low-Code Platform First

- **Rule 50.010**: For admin tool development, first evaluate low-code/no-code platforms (Retool, ToolJet, Appsmith, etc.)
- Custom development is permitted only when exception criteria are met

### 2.2. Custom Development Exception Criteria

Custom development is permitted only when **any** of the following apply:
- Security requirements cannot be met by low-code platforms
- Performance requirements (e.g., <100ms response time) cannot be achieved
- Deep integration with existing systems is required beyond API capabilities
- Regulatory requirements (e.g., data residency) prohibit external platform usage

### 2.3. Platform Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Standard |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Security & Compliance | 30% | SOC2 Type II, RBAC/ABAC support, audit logs |
| Customization | 20% | Custom components, plugin support |
| Data Source Connectivity | 20% | REST/GraphQL/gRPC/direct DB connection support |
| Cost Efficiency | 15% | Evaluate by TCO (dev effort + licensing + operations) |
| AI Integration | 15% | AI Copilot, MCP Server support, natural language queries |

### 2.4. Vendor Lock-in Mitigation

- **Rule 50.011**: Keep platform-specific logic under 30% of total codebase
- Unify data access through APIs; restrict direct DB connections from platforms
- Document migration plans and maintain the ability to migrate to an alternative within 3 months

### 2.5. AI-Native Admin Platforms

- **Rule 50.012**: For new tool selection from 2025 onwards, AI-native features (natural language queries, auto form generation, intelligent suggestions) are mandatory evaluation criteria
- When using AI-generated queries, **human review and approval** is mandatory before execution

### 2.6. TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Evaluation

```
TCO_annual = License_cost + (Dev_hours × Hourly_rate) + Infra_cost + Training_cost + Migration_risk_cost
```

- **Rule 50.013**: Build vs Buy decisions must compare TCO over a minimum of 3 years
- Include hidden costs (customization effort, upgrade handling, security patching) in estimates

### 2.7. Agentic Admin Platforms (2025-2026 Trends)

- Platforms where AI Agents autonomously execute admin operations are emerging
- Agent execution must be subject to audit logging, tracked equally with human operations
- **Rule 50.014**: When adopting agentic platforms, manage agent permissions via RBAC and require human approval (HITL) for destructive operations

### 2.8. Platform Migration Strategy

- Execute migration from existing platforms incrementally using the Strangler Fig pattern
- Automate diff verification during parallel operation periods (minimum 2 weeks)
- Maintain read-only access to the old platform for 30 days after migration completion

---

## Part III. Admin Tool Architecture

### 3.1. Admin Shell Pattern

- **Rule 50.020**: Build admin tool UI frameworks using the "Shell + Module" pattern
- Shell: Centralized authentication, navigation, notifications, and permission control
- Module: Independent modules for each functional area (user management, content management, etc.)

```typescript
// Admin Shell structure example
interface AdminShell {
  auth: AuthModule;          // Authentication & authorization
  navigation: NavModule;     // Navigation & sidebar
  notification: NotifModule; // Global notifications
  featureModules: Map<string, FeatureModule>; // Feature modules
}
```

### 3.2. Micro-Frontend Admin

- **Rule 50.021**: Adopt Micro-Frontend architecture for large-scale admin tools
- Enable independent deployment per team via Module Federation dynamic loading
- Provide shared dependencies (React, design system) from the Shell

### 3.3. Plugin Architecture

- **Rule 50.022**: Admin tools must have plugin extension points for easy custom feature additions
- Implement Plugin Registry and lifecycle (install/enable/disable/uninstall) as standard
- Manage inter-plugin dependencies declaratively; prohibit circular dependencies

### 3.4. Admin API Gateway

- **Rule 50.023**: Route admin APIs through a dedicated API Gateway, separated from end-user APIs
- Unify rate limiting, authentication hardening, and audit log output at the gateway layer
- Auto-generate OpenAPI specs for admin APIs and maintain currency

```yaml
# Admin API Gateway configuration example
admin-gateway:
  rate_limit:
    default: 100/min
    bulk_operations: 10/min
    export: 5/min
  auth:
    required: true
    mfa_required_for:
      - DELETE
      - PATCH (bulk)
  audit:
    log_request_body: true
    log_response_status: true
    redact_fields: ["password", "ssn", "credit_card"]
```

### 3.5. Server-Driven UI (SDUI)

- **Rule 50.024**: Consider Server-Driven UI patterns for dynamic forms, lists, and dashboards
- Define UI structure as JSON Schema on the server side; client renders accordingly
- Benefits: UI changes without deployment, easy A/B testing, multi-platform support

---

## Part IV. Admin Dashboard Design

### 4.1. KPI Monitoring

- **Rule 50.030**: Separate "business metrics" and "operational metrics" on dashboards
- Set trends (day-over-day, week-over-week) and threshold alerts for each KPI
- Display data freshness explicitly (e.g., "Last updated: 5 minutes ago")

### 4.2. Real-Time Streaming Dashboard

- **Rule 50.031**: Provide real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE for critical metrics (error rate, queue depth, active users)
- Maximum polling interval: 30 seconds. If real-time display is impossible, state so explicitly in the UI

### 4.3. Collaborative Dashboard

- **Rule 50.032**: Provide presence indicators when multiple operators view/operate dashboards simultaneously
- Implement Conflict Resolution (Last Write Wins or Merge) for concurrent edits to the same resource

### 4.4. Dashboard Personalization

- **Rule 50.033**: Allow operators to customize widget placement and visibility
- Persist customization settings per user and sync across devices
- Provide role-optimized default layouts

### 4.5. Tech Stack Transparency

- **Rule 50.034**: Make data sources (DB, API, cache) inspectable in developer mode for dashboard displays

---

## Part V. UI/UX Standards & Design System

### 5.1. Modal Design

- **Rule 50.040**: Require confirmation via modal dialog for destructive operations like deletion. Mandate typing the target name (e.g., `DELETE user-123`)
- Disable shortcut keys within modals (misoperation prevention)

### 5.2. Action Feedback

- **Rule 50.041**: Provide real-time feedback (toast notifications, progress bars, status changes) for all operations
- For async operations, notify via job ID and progress polling or WebSocket

### 5.3. Command Palette (⌘K Pattern)

- **Rule 50.042**: Implement a Command Palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K) in admin tools providing:
  - Page navigation (e.g., `Go to User #12345`)
  - Action execution (e.g., `Disable user`)
  - Search (e.g., `Search orders by email`)
  - Recent action history

```typescript
// Command Palette design example
interface CommandPaletteItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  category: 'navigation' | 'action' | 'search' | 'recent';
  shortcut?: string;
  requiresPermission?: string;
  dangerLevel?: 'safe' | 'warning' | 'destructive';
}
```

### 5.4. Natural Language Input

- **Rule 50.043**: AI-powered admin tools should provide natural language query/operation input
- Queries/operations generated from natural language must be **previewed and approved by humans** before execution

### 5.5. Code Editor Mandate (The Code Input Standard)

- **Rule 50.044**: Embed syntax-highlighted editors (Monaco Editor, etc.) for JSON/SQL/regex input fields
- Display validation errors inline immediately

### 5.6. Layout Protection (CSS Containment Protocol)

- **Rule 50.045**: When previewing user-generated content (UGC), use `contain: layout style` to prevent impact on parent element layout

### 5.7. Data Freshness Display (Audit Visibility Protocol)

- **Rule 50.046**: Always display "Last Updated" timestamp and "Updated By" on data display screens
- Show a Stale Indicator for data older than 5 minutes, prompting manual refresh

### 5.8. Zero Jargon

- **Rule 50.047**: Do not use technical jargon in admin panel labels/messages. Displaying raw DB column names or API names is prohibited
- Example: ❌ `is_active` → ✅ `Account Status: Active`

### 5.9. Admin Design System

- **Rule 50.048**: Build and maintain a dedicated admin design system (component library + design tokens)
- Automate Figma-to-code sync (Design Token integration)
- Provide standard components for data tables, forms, filters, and status badges
- **Design token hierarchy**: Global → Semantic → Component-specific

### 5.10. Dark Mode Support

- **Rule 50.049**: Admin panels must support dark mode as standard (reducing eye strain during extended work)
- Auto-follow system settings + manual toggle
- Dark mode contrast ratios must meet WCAG AA standards

---

## Part VI. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 / EAA 2025)

### 6.1. Admin Panel a11y Policy

- **Rule 50.050**: Admin panels must comply with WCAG 2.2 AA as mandatory
- If subject to EAA (European Accessibility Act) enforcement from June 2025, satisfy AA + additional requirements
- a11y must be integrated from the design phase, not retrofitted

### 6.2. Keyboard Navigation

- **Rule 50.051**: All operations must be completable using keyboard only
- Tab order must be logical and predictable
- Implement Focus Trap for modals/drawers (focus must not escape)
- Provide Skip Links ("Skip to main content")

### 6.3. Screen Reader Support

- **Rule 50.052**: Use ARIA attributes appropriately for screen reader operability
- Use ARIA Live Regions for dynamic content updates
- Set `role="grid"` and appropriate `aria-label` for data tables

```html
<!-- ARIA Live Region example: operation result notification -->
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" class="sr-only">
  User "John Smith" account has been disabled
</div>
```

### 6.4. Color Contrast

- **Rule 50.053**: Text-to-background contrast ratio must be 4.5:1 or above (AA standard)
- Use icons + text in addition to color for status displays (color vision diversity support)

### 6.5. EAA 2025 Compliance

- **Rule 50.054**: Admin panels for EU-market products may be EAA targets. Verify:
  - Web Accessibility Directive compliance (public sector)
  - EAA compliance (private sector, effective June 28, 2025)
  - Conduct periodic accessibility audits and reporting

### 6.6. Cognitive Accessibility

- **Rule 50.055**: Include accommodations for users with cognitive disabilities:
  - Clear and consistent navigation structure
  - Progressive Disclosure
  - Error messages with specific corrective steps
  - Timeout extension options

---

## Part VII. Authentication & Authorization Architecture

### 7.1. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

- **Rule 50.060**: Admin panel access control uses RBAC as the foundation with minimum roles:

| Role | Permission Summary |
|------|-------------------|
| Super Admin | Full permissions. Can modify system settings |
| Admin | User management, content management. System settings read-only |
| Operator | Daily operations (content approval, etc.). Cannot delete users |
| Viewer | Read-only. Cannot execute operations |
| Auditor | Audit log viewing only. Cannot execute operations |

- **Rule 50.061**: Role assignment changes are recorded in audit logs; only higher-role holders can make changes
- Self-elevation of roles must be technically impossible by design

### 7.2. ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)

- **Rule 50.062**: When RBAC is insufficient (cross-tenant, time-restricted, etc.), implement ABAC as an additional layer
- Decision attributes: user attributes, resource attributes, environment attributes (time/IP/device), action attributes

```typescript
// ABAC policy example
const policy: ABACPolicy = {
  effect: 'allow',
  subject: { role: 'operator', department: 'support' },
  resource: { type: 'user_profile', sensitivity: 'PII' },
  action: 'read',
  condition: {
    timeRange: { start: '09:00', end: '18:00', timezone: 'America/New_York' },
    ipRange: ['10.0.0.0/8'],
    deviceTrust: 'verified'
  }
};
```

### 7.3. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

- **Rule 50.063**: MFA is **mandatory** for admin panel access
- **Phishing-Resistant MFA** (FIDO2/WebAuthn/Passkeys) takes priority
- SMS authentication is fallback-only; deprecate new registrations

### 7.4. Session Management

- **Rule 50.064**: Admin panel session timeout: maximum 8 hours (idle: 30 minutes)
- Require re-authentication (at least 1 factor) for session extension
- Limit concurrent sessions to 3 per user

### 7.5. JIT (Just-In-Time) Access

- **Rule 50.065**: High-privilege operations (Super Admin equivalent) use JIT access:
  1. Operator requests privilege elevation
  2. Approver reviews and approves the request
  3. Time-limited (maximum 4 hours) privilege grant
  4. Automatic privilege revocation upon expiration
  5. All operations recorded in audit logs

### 7.6. CAEP (Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol)

- **Rule 50.066**: Continuously evaluate risk signals (IP change, device change, anomalous behavior) during sessions; on risk detection, invalidate session or enforce step-up authentication
- Recommended to comply with IETF CAEP standard

### 7.7. Passkey Full Migration Roadmap

| Phase | Period | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | ~2025 Q4 | Passkey registration UI launch. Parallel operation with existing MFA |
| 2 | 2026 Q1-Q2 | Passkey mandatory for new admins. Promote migration for existing admins |
| 3 | 2026 Q3 | Stop new SMS authentication registrations |
| 4 | 2027 Q1 | Full Passkey migration. Deprecate legacy MFA |

### 7.8. SPIFFE/SPIRE Integration (Service-to-Service Auth)

- **Rule 50.067**: Use SPIFFE ID-based mutual authentication for admin tool to backend service access
- In service mesh environments, standardize on mTLS; deprecate API key-based service auth

---

## Part VIII. Security Hardening

### 8.1. Zero Trust Architecture

- **Rule 50.070**: Design admin tools on the Zero Trust model: "Never Trust, Always Verify"
- Do not depend on network boundaries. Verify all requests even over VPN
- Verify Identity + Device Trust + Context on each API call

### 8.2. Network Restrictions

- **Rule 50.071**: Admin panel access requires IP restrictions + VPN/ZTNA combination
- Do not expose admin API endpoints to the public internet
- When behind CDN, block direct origin access

### 8.3. WAF & Rate Limiting

- **Rule 50.072**: Configure admin panel WAF rules:
  - Login attempts: 5/minute (lockout on failure: 15 min)
  - API calls: 100/minute (normal operations), 10/minute (bulk operations)
  - Exports: 5/minute

### 8.4. CSP (Content Security Policy)

- **Rule 50.073**: Configure strict CSP for admin panels:
  - `default-src 'self'`
  - `script-src 'self'` (no inline scripts)
  - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (nonce for CSS-in-JS only)
  - `frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjacking prevention)

### 8.5. Security Testing

- **Rule 50.074**: Implement the following security tests for admin panels:
  - SAST (static analysis): every commit in CI/CD
  - DAST (dynamic analysis): weekly scheduled
  - Penetration testing: annual (external vendor)
  - Permission bypass testing: mandatory before release

### 8.6. Device Trust

- **Rule 50.075**: Require Device Trust for admin panel access:
  - OS patch status verification
  - Disk encryption verification
  - MDM/UEM management confirmation
  - Reject access from unregistered devices

### 8.7. Supply Chain Security (Admin-Specific)

- **Rule 50.076**: Manage admin tool dependencies via SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Scan dependency vulnerabilities weekly; address Critical/High within 72 hours
- → See [security/200_oss_compliance.md](../security/200_oss_compliance.md) for details

### 8.8. AI Red Teaming for Admin

- **Rule 50.077**: Conduct periodic AI Red Teaming for AI-integrated admin tools:
  - Prompt injection attack testing
  - Privilege escalation attack testing
  - Data leakage testing (PII extraction attempts)

### 8.9. RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)

- **Rule 50.078**: Deploy RASP for runtime attack detection and prevention:
  - SQL injection detection
  - Path traversal detection
  - Command injection detection
  - On detection, block the request and alert the security team

### 8.10. Admin-Specific Threat Model

- **Rule 50.079**: Create an admin tool-specific threat model, updated annually:
  - Insider Threat
  - Credential Stuffing
  - Session Hijacking
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Bulk data export information leakage

---

## Part IX. Data Privacy & GDPR Admin Compliance

### 9.1. PII Display Control

- **Rule 50.080**: PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is masked by default
- Unmasking requires step-up authentication + reason entry
- Unmasking operations are recorded in audit logs; unmasking frequency tracked per operator

### 9.2. Data Masking

```typescript
// Data masking strategy example
const maskingRules: Record<string, MaskingStrategy> = {
  email: (v) => v.replace(/(.{2}).*@/, '$1***@'),      // hi***@example.com
  phone: (v) => v.replace(/(\d{3})\d{4}(\d{4})/, '$1****$2'), // 090****1234
  name: (v) => v[0] + '***',                            // J***
  address: () => '***HIDDEN***',
  creditCard: (v) => '**** **** **** ' + v.slice(-4),    // **** **** **** 1234
};
```

### 9.3. Right to Erasure Compliance

- **Rule 50.081**: Enable GDPR Article 17 data deletion requests from the admin panel
- Logical deletion → physical deletion after retention period (30-day rule)
- Provide a deletion item checklist to prevent omissions
- Include backup deletion obligations in operational procedures

### 9.4. Consent Management Dashboard

- **Rule 50.082**: Provide a dashboard displaying user consent status in a unified view
- Implement consent version management and immediate reflection of consent withdrawal

### 9.5. Data Classification Tags

- **Rule 50.083**: Auto-assign data classification tags to data handled in admin panels:

| Classification | Examples | Display Control |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Public** | Public profile | No restrictions |
| **Internal** | Order history | Role-restricted |
| **Confidential** | Email, phone number | Masking + step-up auth |
| **Restricted** | Credit card numbers, SSN | Access prohibited (viewable only in designated systems) |

### 9.6. Automated Data Classification

- **Rule 50.084**: Use ML to auto-classify data fields, preventing tag omissions when new fields are added
- Auto-classification results must be reviewed and approved by humans before application

### 9.7. DPO (Data Protection Officer) Dashboard

- **Rule 50.085**: Provide a dashboard for DPO/privacy officers:

---

## Part X. Audit Logging & Compliance

### 10.1. Immutable Audit Log

- **Rule 50.090**: Record all admin panel operations in an immutable (append-only) audit log
- Required fields:

```typescript
interface AuditLogEntry {
  id: string;                    // UUID v7 (chronologically sortable)
  timestamp: string;             // ISO 8601 (with timezone)

    type: string;                // 'user' | 'order' | 'config'
    id: string;
    tenant?: string;
  };
  changes?: {
    before: Record<string, unknown>;
    after: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
  metadata: {
    requestId: string;           // For distributed tracing
    source: 'admin_ui' | 'api' | 'automation' | 'ai_agent';
    justification?: string;      // Required for destructive operations
    approvedBy?: string;         // For approval workflow
  };
}
```

- **Rule 50.091**: Make audit log deletion/modification technically impossible (Write-Once Storage)

### 10.2. Log Retention & Search

- **Rule 50.092**: Minimum audit log retention: 7 years (SOC2/GDPR requirements)
- Provide full-text search (Elasticsearch, etc.) with arbitrary filtering
- Provide log export (CSV/JSON); export operations are also audit logged

### 10.3. Tamper-Evident Logging

- **Rule 50.093**: Implement Merkle Tree hash chain-based log tamper detection
- Auto-verify hash chain integrity at regular intervals (e.g., hourly)
- Immediately alert the security team upon tamper detection

### 10.4. SOC2 Compliance Checklist

- **Rule 50.094**: Admin tools must address SOC2 Trust Services Criteria:

| TSC | Compliance Item |
|-----|----------------|
| CC6.1 | Logical access controls (RBAC/ABAC) |
| CC6.2 | Authentication mechanisms (MFA mandatory) |

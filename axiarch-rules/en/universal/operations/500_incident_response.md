## Part I: Foundation & Philosophy

### §1. Crisis Management Philosophy & Fundamental Principles

-   **Law (Resilience-First Principle)**: The purpose of crisis management is not "achieving zero failures" but "building resilience to recover rapidly and maintain business continuity when failures occur." Operate under the assumption that perfect prevention is impossible, and implement the four capabilities of **Detection, Response, Recovery, and Learning** across the organization.
-   **Proactive vs Reactive**:

    | Approach | Content | Examples |
    |:---------|:--------|:--------|
    | **Proactive** | Prepare before incidents occur | BIA, exercises, runbook creation, chaos engineering |
    | **Reactive** | Respond after incidents occur | Incident response, post-mortem |

    **Mandate**: Target a resource allocation ratio of **Proactive 70% : Reactive 30%**. Organizations consumed by reactive responses are in a low maturity state.

-   **Five Fundamental Principles**:
    1.  **Assume Breach**: Assume not "someday we'll be breached" but "we may already be breached"
    2.  **Blast Radius Minimization**: Always prioritize designs that minimize the scope of impact
    3.  **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain service in degraded mode rather than total shutdown
    4.  **Transparency**: "Silence breeds distrust" — communicate status continuously even without progress
    5.  **Blameless Culture**: Focus on system improvement, not individual blame

-   **Cross-Reference**: `000_core_mindset.md` (Priority hierarchy), `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §4 (SLI/SLO)

### §2. Framework Compliance

-   **Law**: Crisis management and BCP MUST be built using systematic approaches aligned with international standard frameworks. Relying solely on proprietary frameworks is prohibited.
-   **Framework Mapping**:

    | Framework | Application Area | Mapping to This Rule |
    |:---------|:----------------|:--------------------:|
    | **ISO 22301:2019** | Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) | §3 BIA, §11 BCP, §13 DR Strategy |
    | **NIST CSF 2.0** | Cybersecurity Framework (6-function model) | §6 Incident Flow, §7 Cyber Incidents |
    | **NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3** | Incident Response Guide (published April 2025 — **fully revised to CSF 2.0 integrated model**. Retired the legacy 4-phase model and maps IR activities to CSF 2.0's 6 functions) | §6 Incident Flow (CSF 2.0 integrated), §5-§8 Incident Response |
    | **ITIL 4** | IT Service Management | §5 Incident Management, §18 Post-Mortem |
    | **EU DORA** | Digital Operational Resilience (enforced Jan 2025) | §21 DORA Regulatory Integration |
    | **EU NIS2** | Network & Information Security Directive (Oct 2024 transposition deadline) | §32 NIS2 Integration |
    | **EU CRA** | Cyber Resilience Act (entered into force Dec 2024, reporting obligations Sep 2026) | §33 CRA Integration |
    | **APRA CPS 230** | Operational Risk Management Standard (Australia, enforced Jul 2025) | §34 Incident Reporting International Harmonization |

-   **NIST CSF 2.0 Six Functions Mapping**:
    - **Govern**: §19 Crisis Management Governance, §21 DORA Regulatory Integration
    - **Identify**: §3 BIA, §4 Risk Assessment
    - **Protect**: Delegated to `security/000_security_privacy.md`
    - **Detect**: §5 Incident Response Framework, §22 AIOps, `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §10 Observability
    - **Respond**: §5-§10 Incident Response, §26 Incident Automation
    - **Recover**: §13-§15 DR Strategy & Data Protection, §28 Reputation Recovery

## Part II: Risk Analysis & Preparation

### §3. BIA (Business Impact Analysis)

-   **Law**: Before designing crisis management and BCP, a **BIA (Business Impact Analysis)** MUST be conducted to define business process priorities and RTO/RPO. BCP without BIA is a plan with undefined protection targets and is therefore invalid.
-   **Business Priority Classification**:

    | Tier | Classification | RTO Target | RPO Target | Examples |
    |:-----|:--------------|:-----------|:-----------|:---------|
    | **Tier 1 (Mission Critical)** | Immediate recovery required | ≦ 1 hour | ≦ 15 min | Authentication, payments, core API |
    | **Tier 2 (Business Critical)** | Same-day recovery | ≦ 4 hours | ≦ 1 hour | Search, user dashboard |
    | **Tier 3 (Important)** | Next business day | ≦ 24 hours | ≦ 4 hours | Admin panel, report generation |
    | **Tier 4 (General)** | Planned recovery | ≦ 72 hours | ≦ 24 hours | Internal tools, batch processing |

-   **BIA Extended Metrics**:
    - **MTPD (Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption)**: Maximum downtime the business can sustain
    - **WRT (Work Recovery Time)**: Additional work time required to return to normal business level after RTO
    - **MBCO (Minimum Business Continuity Objective)**: Minimum level of business operations to maintain (e.g., 50% processing capacity)
    - **Relationship**: MTPD ≧ RTO + WRT must always be verified

-   **BIA Execution Obligations**:
    - **Initial**: Conduct BIA at project inception and record in Blueprint
    - **Updates**: Annually, or upon significant feature additions/architecture changes
    - **Record Items**: Business process name, dependent systems/services, impact of downtime (revenue, legal, reputation), RTO/RPO/WRT/MTPD/MBCO
    - **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize upstream/downstream dependencies of each business process to identify cascade failure risks
-   **Cross-Reference**: `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §7 (RPO/RTO), §4 (SLI/SLO)

### §4. Risk Assessment & Threat Modeling

-   **Law**: Regular risk assessments MUST be conducted to systematically manage threat identification, evaluation, and countermeasures.
-   **Threat Catalog (Minimum Coverage)**:

    | Category | Threat Examples | Impact |
    |:---------|:---------------|:------:|
    | **Cyber Attacks** | Ransomware, DDoS, data breach, supply chain attack | Critical |
    | **AI/ML Threats** | Prompt injection, model poisoning, deepfake | Critical |
    | **Infrastructure Failure** | Cloud region outage, DB failure, CDN failure, DNS failure | High |
    | **Human Risk** | Key person departure, insider threat, social engineering | High |
    | **External Dependencies** | Payment service outage, AI API vendor outage, auth infra failure | High |
    | **Natural Disasters** | Earthquake, typhoon, flooding (data center locations) | Medium-High |
    | **Climate Change** | Extreme weather frequency, heat wave DC cooling failure | Medium-High |
    | **Geopolitical Risk** | Sanctions, data sovereignty regulation changes, supply chain disruption | Medium-High |
    | **Pandemic** | Infectious disease outbreak, office closure, staffing shortage | Medium-High |
    | **Regulatory** | Data localization requirements, emergency regulatory changes | Medium |
    | **Quantum Computing** | HNDL attacks, cryptographic breaks, long-term secret data exposure | Medium (future Critical) |
    | **OT/ICS** | Industrial control system attacks, SCADA malware | High (applicable sectors) |

-   **Risk Matrix (Evaluation Criteria)**:

    | | Impact: Low | Impact: Medium | Impact: High | Impact: Critical |
    |:------------|:-----------|:-------------|:------------|:----------------|
    | **Probability: High** | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
    | **Probability: Medium** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
    | **Probability: Low** | Low | Low | Medium | High |

    **Action**: Prepare countermeasures (runbooks, failover plans) in advance for all threats rated High or above.
-   **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
    - Participation in industry information sharing organizations such as ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) is recommended
    - Threat modeling based on MITRE ATT&CK framework
    - Integration of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) feeds into monitoring systems
-   **Review Cycle**: Review risk assessments quarterly to add new threats and re-evaluate risk levels.

## Part III: Incident Response

### §5. Incident Response Framework (War Room)

-   **Severity Levels**:

    | Level | Definition | Initial Response | Resolution Target | Communication |
    |:------|:----------|:----------------|:-----------------|:-------------|
    | **SEV-1 (Critical)** | Full service outage, data loss, security breach | **Within 15 min** | **Within 1 hour** | Status page + company-wide + exec report |
    | **SEV-2 (High)** | Major feature outage (payment, auth failure) | **Within 30 min** | **Within 4 hours** | Status page + team notification |
    | **SEV-3 (Medium)** | Non-critical feature issues, performance degradation | **Within 2 hours** | **Within 24 hours** | Chat notification channel |
    | **SEV-4 (Low)** | Minor bugs, UI breaks, log warning increase | **Next business day** | **Next sprint** | Issue Tracker |

-   **War Room Setup Criteria**: When SEV-1 or SEV-2 occurs, **immediately** establish a War Room.
    - **Physical**: Slack channel `#incident-yyyy-mm-dd-{summary}` + video conference
    - **Automation**: Auto-summon on-call via PagerDuty upon SEV-1 detection

-   **Roles (RACI)**:

    | Role | Responsibility | Prohibited |
    |:-----|:--------------|:-----------|
    | **Incident Commander** | Decision-making, prioritization, escalation decisions | Direct technical work |
    | **Ops Lead** | Direct and execute recovery work, technical decisions | Independent action without Commander |
    | **Comms Lead** | Status updates every 30 min, user/internal notifications | Publishing unverified information |
    | **Scribe** | Timestamped recording of all events and decisions | Deferring documentation |
    | **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** | Domain-specific technical support (DB, infra, security) | Bypassing chain of command |

-   **On-Call Escalation**:
    - Primary → **5 min no response** → Auto-escalate to Secondary
    - Secondary → **10 min no response** → Auto-escalate to Engineering Manager
    - All unresponsive → **15 min** → Emergency notification to CTO/VP

### §6. Incident Response Flow (NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3 / CSF 2.0 Integrated Model)

-   **Law**: Incident response MUST follow **NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3 (published April 2025)**. Rev.3 retired the legacy 4-phase model and introduced an **integrated model that maps IR activities to NIST CSF 2.0's 6 functions**. Incident response is positioned not as a "one-time event" but as "part of continuous cybersecurity risk management."

-   **CSF 2.0 Integrated IR Model (6-Function Mapping)**:

    | CSF Function | IR Activity | This Rule Mapping |
    |:------------|:-----------|:-----------------|
    | **Govern** | IR policy establishment, risk governance, regulatory requirements integration, management responsibility definition | §19 Governance, §48 CISO Responsibility |
    | **Identify** | Asset/risk assessment, BIA, threat intelligence integration, CSF 2.0 Community Profile utilization | §3 BIA, §4 Risk Assessment |
    | **Protect** | Preparation activities (runbook maintenance, contact list maintenance, forensic tool preparation, training) | §17 Runbooks, §43 Training, `security/000_security_privacy.md` |
    | **Detect** | Monitoring alerts, anomaly detection, triage determination, regulatory reporting trigger assessment | §5 Incident Response Framework, §22 AIOps |
    | **Respond** | Containment, eradication, evidence preservation, communication, regulatory reporting | §5-§10 IR overall, §34 Regulatory Reporting |
    | **Recover** | Service recovery, post-mortem, improvement actions, reputation recovery | §13-§15 DR, §18 Post-Mortem, §28 Reputation |

-   **Legacy Model Compatibility Mapping**:

    > Mapping between Rev.2's legacy 4-phase model and Rev.3's CSF 2.0 integrated model (migration reference):

    | Rev.2 (Legacy 4-Phase) | Rev.3 (CSF 2.0 Integrated) |
    |:----------------------|:--------------------------|
    | **Phase 1: Preparation** | → **Govern** + **Identify** + **Protect** |
    | **Phase 2: Detection & Analysis** | → **Detect** + **Respond** (analysis portion) |
    | **Phase 3: Containment, Eradication & Recovery** | → **Respond** + **Recover** |
    | **Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity** | → **Govern** (improvement feedback) + **Identify** (risk re-assessment) |

-   **Govern + Identify + Protect (Preparation)**:
    - Pre-create and periodically review runbooks (see §17)
    - Maintain emergency contact lists (secure alternatives beyond Slack: phone, SMS, alternative chat)
    - Pre-prepare forensic tools and log preservation procedures
    - **Regulatory Report Templates**: Pre-prepare report templates for DORA/NIS2/CRA/GDPR/Global Privacy Laws/APRA CPS 230 regulations (see §34)
    - **CSF 2.0 Community Profile**: Set IR priorities based on the incident risk management Community Profile defined by NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3
-   **Detect (Detection & Analysis)**:
    - Detection via monitoring alerts or user reports
    - **Triage**: Immediate severity level determination (see §5 matrix)
    - Initial impact assessment (affected users, affected features, data loss status)
    - **Evidence Preservation**: Immediate preservation of logs, screenshots, memory dumps (§37 Chain of Custody compliant)
    - **Regulatory Report Trigger Assessment**: Immediate determination of whether the incident triggers regulatory reporting obligations (see §34)
-   **Respond**:
    - **Short-term containment**: Immediately prevent scope expansion (network isolation, API blocking, Kill Switch)
    - **Eradication**: Remove root cause (malware removal, vulnerability patching, access path closure)
    - **Communication**: Execute stakeholder notifications per §9-§10
    - **Regulatory Reporting**: Execute statutory reporting per §34 (comply with shortest deadline)
-   **Recover (Recovery & Post-Incident)**:
    - **Recovery**: Phased service recovery (canary release validation recommended)
    - Conduct post-mortem **within 48 hours** (see §18)
    - Create and track improvement action items → **Govern** feedback loop
    - Append lessons to project lessons log
    - Submit final report to regulatory authorities (if applicable)

-   **6-Step Incident Flow (Quick Reference)**:
    1.  **Detect**: Monitoring alert or user report
    2.  **Classify**: Severity level determination + War Room setup decision + regulatory report trigger assessment
    3.  **Declare**: Declare in incident channel (e.g., `🔴 SEV-1: Payment Function Outage in Progress`)
    4.  **Respond**: Rollback / Hotfix / Kill Switch / Temporary block
    5.  **Resolve**: Status page update, recovery notification, begin monitoring
    6.  **Review**: Conduct Post-Mortem within 48 hours → Govern feedback

### §7. Cyber Incident-Specific Response

-   **Law**: Cyber incidents require different response protocols than general system failures. Prepare threat-type-specific playbooks in advance.

#### §7.1. Ransomware Response Playbook

-   **Threat Landscape (2025-2026)**:
    - **RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service)**: Significantly lowered barrier to entry for ransomware attacks. Even low-skill attackers can execute sophisticated attacks
    - **Double Extortion**: Two-pronged attacks combining data encryption + data exposure threats have become mainstream
    - **Pure Extortion**: Increasing tactic of stealing data without encryption and demanding ransom under threat of publication
    - **AI-Enhanced Phishing**: AI-generated, highly accurate spear phishing and vishing (voice phishing) increasing as initial intrusion vectors
    - **Low-Volume, High-Impact Attacks**: Tactics that exfiltrate large amounts of data without encryption to evade detection
    - **Primary Targets**: Manufacturing, healthcare, education, energy, and financial sectors

-   **Immediate Response (Golden Hour — First Hour)**:
    1.  **Isolate**: Immediately isolate systems suspected of infection from the network (physically/logically disconnect)
    2.  **Payment Prohibition**: Ransom payment is **prohibited in principle** (only exception judgment under legal counsel is permitted)
    3.  **Evidence Preservation**: Forensic preservation of memory dumps, logs, and infected files (see §37)
    4.  **Backup Verification**: Verify backup contamination status (confirm existence of immutable backups)
    5.  **Law Enforcement Notification**: Report to local police, JPCERT/CC (Japan), FBI IC3 (US), etc.
    6.  **Regulatory Reporting**: If DORA/NIS2 applicable, initiate initial notification to regulators (see §34)
    7.  **IR Retainer Contact**: Immediately contact pre-contracted incident response retainer firm (see §47)
    8.  **Cyber Insurance Notification**: Initial notification to insurance company (confirm evidence preservation procedures required for claims)

-   **Recovery Procedures**:
    - Restore from clean backups (see §15)
    - Complete identification and closure of intrusion paths
    - Forced rotation of all credentials
    - Phased service restoration (isolated environment verification → restricted release → full restoration)
    - Initiate dark web monitoring if data theft is confirmed

-   **Defenses**:
    - Strict adherence to **3-2-1-1 Backup Rule** (see §15)
    - Mandatory implementation of **Immutable Backups**
    - **Network Segmentation** for lateral movement prevention
    - **EDR/XDR** deployment on all endpoints
    - **AI-Aware Phishing Training**: Strengthen employee education assuming AI-generated phishing
    - **MFA Mandatory**: Mandate multi-factor authentication for all privileged accounts and VPN access

-   **Cross-Reference**: §27 (Cyber Insurance), §47 (Ransomware Negotiation & IR Retainer)

#### §7.2. Data Breach Response Protocol

-   **Stop the Bleeding**:
    - When data breach or unauthorized access is suspected, execute **Stop the Bleeding without hesitation**
    - **Prioritize**: API key invalidation, affected server isolation, access token revocation
-   **Impact Assessment**:
    - Identify type and volume of leaked data (PII, payment data, credentials)
    - Identify affected users
    - Determine breach timeline (from when to when)
-   **Legal Notification Obligations**:

    | Regulation | Notification Deadline | Notification Target |
    |:----------|:---------------------|:-------------------|
    | **GDPR (EU)** | **Within 72 hours** | Supervisory authority + affected data subjects |
    | **Applicable Regional Law** | **Preliminary: promptly / Final: within 30 days** | PPC + affected individuals |
    | **CCPA/CPRA (US CA)** | **Without unreasonable delay** | CA Attorney General + consumers |
    | **DORA (EU Financial)** | **Major ICT incident: within 4 hours (initial)** | Competent financial supervisory authority |
    | **NIS2 (EU)** | **Early warning: within 24 hours / Notification: within 72 hours** | Competent CSIRT + supervisory authority |

-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md`, `security/100_data_governance.md`, §34 (Incident Reporting International Harmonization)

#### §7.3. DDoS Attack Response

-   **Multi-Layer Defense**:
    - **L3/L4**: Traffic filtering via CDN/WAF (Cloudflare, AWS Shield, etc.)
    - **L7**: Dynamic rate limit enforcement, temporary CAPTCHA application
    - **Auto-scaling**: Automatic infrastructure scaling for traffic surges
    - **Anycast**: Traffic distribution via DNS Anycast
-   **Trigger Criteria**: Activate DDoS response protocol upon detecting **10x or more** request surge vs. baseline
-   **Cost Protection**: Set auto-scaling cost limits to prevent cost explosion from DDoS attacks (see §31 FinOps)

#### §7.4. Supply Chain Attack Response

-   **Immediate Response**:
    - Identify and uninstall compromised dependency package versions
    - Rotate all credentials across affected environments
    - Rapid impact assessment based on SBOM
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/200_oss_compliance.md` (SBOM/SCA/Supply Chain Security)

#### §7.5. Zero-Day Vulnerability Response

-   **Law**: When a zero-day vulnerability is disclosed, prepare emergency response protocols to prevent attacks until patches are available.
-   **Immediate Response (Pre-Patch)**:
    1.  **Virtual Patching**: Emergency WAF/IPS/IDS rule additions to block attack vectors
    2.  **Attack Surface Reduction**: Temporary disabling of vulnerable features (Kill Switch, Feature Flag)
    3.  **Enhanced Monitoring**: Immediately add detection rules for vulnerability exploitation patterns
    4.  **Threat Intelligence Check**: Verify known Exploits / PoC / IoC (Indicators of Compromise)
-   **Patch Application**:
    - Emergency patch testing → staging validation → canary deploy → full rollout
    - **SLA**: Zero-days with Critical CVSS score 9.0+ must be patched **within 24 hours**
-   **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)**:
    - For own product vulnerabilities: Follow responsible disclosure policy, publish after fix
    - Under EU CRA, actively exploited vulnerabilities must be reported to ENISA **within 24 hours** (see §33)
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md` (Vulnerability Management), §40 (Zero-Day Details)

#### §7.6. Identity-Based Attack Response

-   **Law**: In 2025-2026, identity is the most attacked surface. Attacks that "log in" rather than "break in" have become mainstream. Prepare specific response protocols for identity-based attacks.

-   **Key Attack Vectors & Countermeasures**:

    | Attack Method | Overview | Countermeasure |
    |:-------------|:---------|:--------------|
    | **MFA Fatigue Attack** | Flood of MFA push notifications to trick users into approving | Number Matching MFA, FIDO2/WebAuthn migration, anomalous MFA request detection |
    | **SIM Swapping** | Deceive carrier to hijack SIM, bypassing SMS-MFA | Deprecate SMS-MFA → authenticator apps/FIDO2, telecom PIN setup |
    | **Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)** | Steal session cookies via proxy, bypassing MFA | Token binding, conditional access (compliant device required) |
    | **Session Hijacking** | Unauthorized access via stolen session tokens | Short-lived session tokens, continuous authentication, device binding |
    | **Credential Stuffing** | Automated authentication attempts using leaked credential DBs (Dark Web) | Passwordless authentication, Have I Been Pwned integration, rate limit hardening |
    | **Help Desk Attack** | Impersonate IT to request password resets | Multi-step identity verification, out-of-band confirmation, reset operation audit logs |

-   **Immediate Response (Identity Compromise Detected)**:
    1.  **Invalidate affected account sessions**: Force logout from all sessions and devices
    2.  **Credential rotation**: Immediate reset of passwords, API keys, and tokens
    3.  **Lateral movement investigation**: Investigate impact scope based on compromised account's access privileges
    4.  **Temporary conditional access tightening**: Force MFA re-authentication across the affected organization
    5.  **IDP log preservation**: Immediate preservation of Azure AD/Okta/Google Workspace sign-in and audit logs

-   **Prevention Strategy**:
    - **Passwordless authentication**: Progressive adoption of FIDO2/WebAuthn/Passkeys (ultimate goal: complete password elimination)
    - **Continuous Authentication**: Risk-based re-authentication during sessions (triggered by anomalous behavior)
    - **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Just-in-Time (JIT) access, strict least privilege enforcement
    - **ITDR (Identity Threat Detection and Response)**: Deploy dedicated ITDR products or XDR identity capabilities

-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/000_security_privacy.md` (Authentication & Access Control), §8 (Deepfake/Social Engineering)

#### §7.7. Non-Human Identity (NHI) Security & Incident Response

-   **Law**: API keys, service accounts, OAuth clients, machine-to-machine tokens, and other **Non-Human Identities (NHI)** vastly outnumber human identities (typically 10:1 to 50:1 ratio) yet are often inadequately managed, creating significant security risks. Establish NHI-specific crisis management protocols.

-   **NHI Risk Categories**:

    | Risk | Overview | Impact |
    |:-----|:---------|:-------|
    | **Privilege Sprawl** | Accumulation of overly-permissioned service accounts | Massive blast radius upon compromise |
    | **Lifecycle Management Gap** | API keys/tokens never retired or rotated | Long-term unauthorized access risk |
    | **Hardcoded Secrets** | API keys directly written in source code/CI-CD configs | Public exposure on GitHub etc. → immediate compromise |
    | **Zombie Accounts** | Unused but remaining service accounts | Hard-to-detect attack paths |
    | **OAuth Over-Permission** | OAuth apps with unnecessarily broad scopes | Lateral movement via third parties |

-   **Incident Response (NHI Compromise)**:
    1.  **Immediately invalidate affected NHI**: Revoke API keys, disable service accounts, cancel OAuth tokens
    2.  **Secret scanning**: Scan all repositories, CI/CD pipelines, environment variables (GitGuardian, Trufflehog, etc.)
    3.  **Lateral movement investigation**: Identify impact scope based on compromised NHI's permissions
    4.  **Rotate all related credentials**: Update credentials for all services that interacted with the compromised NHI
    5.  **Audit log review**: Analyze historical logs for anomalous API call patterns by the NHI

-   **Prevention Measures**:
    - **Secret management**: Centralized management via HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc. Hardcoding prohibited
    - **Automated rotation**: Periodic automatic rotation of API keys/tokens (maximum 90 days)
    - **Least privilege**: Restrict service account permissions to the minimum required for job execution
    - **NHI inventory**: Complete inventory of all NHIs with periodic updates (quarterly)
    - **Expiration mandate**: Set expiration on all API keys/tokens. Indefinite tokens prohibited
    - **CI/CD pipeline security**: Prioritize OIDC federation/Workload Identity for secret usage in pipelines

    ```yaml
    # GitHub Actions — OIDC Workload Identity Example (avoid hardcoded secrets)
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: 'projects/123/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/pool/providers/provider'
          service_account: 'deploy@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
    ```

-   **Cyber Insurance Impact**: NHI compromises are increasingly excluded from cyber insurance coverage (see §27)

## Part IV: AI Threat Response

### §8. AI-Driven Threat Response

-   **Law**: Prepare specific response procedures for new threat types that exploit AI technology (Deepfake, prompt injection, AI-generated phishing, etc.).
-   **Threat Catalog**:

    | Threat | Impact | Response |
    |:------|:-------|:--------|
    | **Prompt Injection** | AI feature abuse, harmful content generation | Global Kill Switch (see §9.2), guardrail hardening |
    | **AI API Cost Attack** | Cloud bankruptcy via mass requests | Rate limiting, cost circuit breaker |
    | **Deepfake Fraud** | Unauthorized approvals via impersonation | MFA hardening, out-of-band verification |
    | **AI-Generated Phishing** | High-precision phishing emails/sites | Security awareness training, email auth (DMARC) |
    | **Model Poisoning** | AI output manipulation via training data contamination | Data pipeline integrity verification, model signing |
    | **LLM Jailbreak** | Safety guardrail bypass | Multi-layer guardrails, output filtering hardening |
    | **AI-Generated Malware** | Automated mass production of polymorphic malware | EDR/XDR hardening, behavior analysis |
    | **Shadow AI** | Unauthorized AI tool usage in business operations | AI governance policy, DLP integration |
    | **Adversarial ML** | AI model misclassification via input manipulation | Adversarial testing, input validation hardening |

-   **Deepfake Countermeasure Protocol**:
    - **Detection Technology**: Consider deploying deepfake detection tools (Microsoft Video Authenticator, Sensity AI, etc.)
    - **Authentication Hardening**: For CEO fraud countermeasures, mandate **out-of-band authentication** (direct confirmation via separate channel) for high-value transfers and critical decisions
    - **Voice Cloning Countermeasures**: Introduce **codeword system** for voice-based approvals (phone-based wire transfer instructions, etc.) using a pre-agreed secret phrase for identity verification
    - **Video Authentication**: Anti-impersonation protocol for video conferences using real-time action instructions (requesting specific movements) for verification
    - **All-Staff Education**: Regular sharing of deepfake attack case studies and training (see §43)

-   **Shadow AI Management**:
    - DLP (Data Loss Prevention) integration to detect unauthorized AI tool usage in business operations
    - Maintain approved AI tool registry and usage guidelines
    - Quarterly Shadow AI risk assessment and employee awareness

-   **Global Kill Switch Implementation Mandate**:
    - AI feature emergency shutdown switch MUST be implemented via **Edge Config** or **DB flag** (`system_settings`) requiring **no re-deployment**
    - Middleware checks `ai_enabled`, `billing_enabled` flags and immediately returns 503 when OFF
    - **"Fix code and re-deploy" is too slow** — enable shutdown in seconds

    ```typescript
    // Global Kill Switch — Middleware Implementation Example
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

    export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
      // Edge Config or DB flags check (no re-deploy required)
      const flags = await getSystemFlags(); // Edge Config / KV Store

      if (!flags.ai_enabled && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/ai')) {
        return NextResponse.json(
          { error: 'AI_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_DISABLED', message: 'AI features are temporarily suspended' },
          { status: 503 }
        );
      }

      if (!flags.billing_enabled && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/billing')) {
        return NextResponse.json(
          { error: 'BILLING_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_DISABLED', message: 'Billing features are temporarily suspended' },
          { status: 503 }
        );
      }
    }
    ```

## Part V: Communication

### §9. Crisis Communication Management

-   **Law**: "Silence breeds distrust." During incidents, status MUST be communicated continuously even if not yet resolved.

#### §9.1. Status Page Management

-   **Component-Level Health Monitoring**:
    - Status pages MUST display operational status of each service component **individually in real-time**
    - Maintain visibility so users can immediately identify "which component is affected" rather than "general outage"

-   **Component Categories (Minimum)**:

    | Category | Monitoring Target (Example) | Health Check Method (Example) |
    |:---------|:--------------------------|:----------------------------:|
    | **Web Application** | Frontend / Edge | HTTP 200 response check |
    | **API** | Backend API | Response time ≦ threshold |
    | **Database** | Primary DB | Connection pool utilization |
    | **Authentication** | Auth infrastructure | Login success rate |
    | **Media Delivery** | CDN / Storage | CDN hit rate |
    | **External Integrations** | Payment / AI / Email etc. | Response success rate |

-   **Status Levels (4 Tiers)**:
    - `Operational` — Normal operation
    - `Degraded Performance` — Performance degradation
    - `Partial Outage` — Partial failure
    - `Major Outage` — Full outage

-   **Status Transition Flow**:
    - `Investigating` → `Identified` → `Monitoring` → `Resolved`

#### §9.2. Incident Notification Templates

-   **Law**: Incident notifications MUST be issued based on **pre-prepared templates**. Hastily written free-form text increases the risk of information omission and inappropriate expressions.

-   **Initial Report Template**:
    ```
    [Incident Report] Notice regarding {Component Name}

    Thank you for using {Service Name}.
    We are currently experiencing {Symptom} with {Component Name}.

    ■ Occurrence Time: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}
    ■ Impact Scope: {Affected Features}
    ■ Current Status: Investigating / Recovery in Progress
    ■ Next Update ETA: {HH:MM UTC}

    We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
    We will update this page as soon as recovery is confirmed.
    ```

-   **Required Fields (Initial, Update, Recovery Reports)**:
    - **Occurrence Time**: Exact date/time of first detection (with timezone)
    - **Impact Scope**: Identification of affected features and user segments
    - **Current Status**: "Investigating / Cause Identified / Recovery in Progress / Recovered"
    - **Next Update ETA**: Scheduled time for next update (prevents silence)

-   **Update Frequency**:

    | Level | Status Page Update | Internal Update |
    |:------|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
    | **SEV-1** | Every 30 min | Every 15 min |
    | **SEV-2** | Every 1 hour | Every 30 min |
    | **SEV-3** | Every 4 hours or on change | As needed |

#### §9.3. Media & Social Media Response

-   **Principles**: For SEV-1 incidents that may attract external media attention:
    - **Single Spokesperson**: External media communication authority limited to one designated person
    - **Fact-Checking**: Monitor misinformation on social media and issue rapid corrections via official channels
    - **Legal Review**: Press releases for major incidents (data breaches, etc.) require mandatory legal review
    - **Dark Site Preparation**: Pre-prepared notification pages for major incidents (ready for immediate publication)

### §10. Stakeholder Notification & Reputation Management

-   **Stakeholder Notification Matrix**:

    | Stakeholder | SEV-1 | SEV-2 | SEV-3 | Notification Method |
    |:-----------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------------|
    | **Executive Team** | ✅ Immediate | ✅ Within 1 hour | ❌ | Phone + Email |
    | **Company/Team** | ✅ Immediate | ✅ Immediate | ✅ | Slack + Email |
    | **Users** | ✅ Immediate | ✅ Within 1 hour | ❌ | Status Page |
    | **Regulators** | ✅ Within legal deadline | △ If required | ❌ | Official letter/Portal |
    | **Partners** | ✅ Within 1 hour | △ If required | ❌ | Email + Phone |
    | **Cyber Insurance Provider** | ✅ Per contract terms | △ If required | ❌ | Designated contact |

-   **Data Breach User Email**:
    - Use legally vetted templates for swift and transparent notification
    - Required information: what happened, impact scope, user actions required (password change, etc.), contact information
-   **Cross-Reference**: `security/100_data_governance.md` (GDPR/Global Privacy Laws notification obligations)

## Part VI: Business Continuity

### §11. BCP (Business Continuity Plan)

-   **Law**: BCP is not solely an IT department responsibility — it defines the **organization-wide business continuity capability**. Maintain it in compliance with ISO 22301 with executive approval.
-   **BCP Required Elements**:

    | Element | Content |
    |:--------|:--------|
    | **Scope** | Clear definition of target operations, systems, and locations |
    | **BIA Results** | Reflect Business Impact Analysis from §3 |
    | **Recovery Strategy** | Recovery procedures and resources per tier |
    | **Roles & Responsibilities** | Command structure and RACI matrix during BCP activation |
    | **Communication Plan** | Internal/external notification procedures and contact list |
    | **Alternatives** | Remote work, alternative infrastructure, manual operation procedures |
    | **Testing & Training** | See §16 Tabletop Exercises |
    | **Regulatory Requirements Mapping** | Mapping of applicable regulations (DORA/NIS2/CRA) to BCP |

-   **Key Person Risk Elimination**:
    - **Eliminate** "code only a specific engineer can manage"
    - Maintain a state where **anyone** can perform recovery through documentation and code standardization
    - **Bus Factor ≧ 2**: For all critical systems, maintain at least 2 people capable of operation and recovery

-   **Emergency Contact List**:
    - **Secure** emergency contact methods beyond Slack (phone, SMS, alternative chat)
    - Update contact list **quarterly** to prevent staleness
    - **Reachability Test**: Conduct test notifications using the actual emergency contact list semi-annually
    - **Out-of-Band Communication**: Secure alternative communication methods in case primary communication infrastructure itself fails

-   **Remote Work BCP**:
    - Verify VPN/Zero Trust connection capacity can handle simultaneous all-employee connections
    - Guarantee remote access to primary tools (source code, CI/CD, monitoring)
    - Pre-identify alternative work locations when office is unavailable

### §12. Vendor & Supply Chain BCP

-   **Law**: Pre-define the response flow for when external vendor failures (cloud providers, SaaS, payment services, etc.) cascade to your services. "It's the vendor's problem, we can only wait" constitutes **abandonment of business continuity**.
-   **Vendor Failure Response Flow**:
    1.  **Detect**: Vendor status page monitoring + internal monitoring anomaly detection
    2.  **Impact Assessment**: Immediately assess which features/user segments are affected
    3.  **User Notification**: Post impact scope and status on your status page (even while waiting for vendor recovery — **silence is prohibited**)
    4.  **Alternative Execution**: Execute fallback measures (alternative service switchover, degraded mode, etc.)
    5.  **Recovery Verification**: After vendor recovery, verify normal operation of your service

-   **Vendor BCP Verification Obligation**: For critical vendors (High risk tier), verify **annually**:
    - BCP readiness status
    - RPO/RTO settings and SLA alignment
    - Incident history and recovery track record for the past year
    - Redundancy and backup infrastructure
    - **Contractual Exit Strategy**: Migration plans to avoid vendor lock-in

-   **Pre-Prepared Vendor Alternatives**: For vendors that constitute SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
    - Complete alternative service selection in advance
    - Conduct minimum connectivity verification (PoC)
    - Document switchover procedures in runbooks (see §17)
    - **"Searching for alternatives after an outage" is too late**

-   **Vendor Risk Tier Classification**:

    | Tier | Criteria | Alternative Requirements | Examples |
    |:-----|:---------|:----------------------|:---------|
    | **Critical** | Outage = immediate full service outage | Pre-verified alternative service | Cloud provider, auth infra |
    | **High** | Outage = major feature outage | Alternative candidate selected | Payment, CDN, email delivery |
    | **Medium** | Outage = UX degradation | Graceful Degradation design | AI API, analytics tools |
    | **Low** | Outage = minimal impact | Manual alternative possible | CMS, internal tools |

-   **NIS2 Supply Chain Requirements**:
    - Supply chain security assessment based on NIS2 Article 21
    - Regular evaluation of vendor security practices
    - Incorporation of cybersecurity obligation clauses into contracts
    - Integration of incident management plans across the supply chain

-   **Cross-Reference**: §17 (Runbooks), `security/000_security_privacy.md` §10 (Vendor Security Management)

## Part VII: Disaster Recovery

### §13. Disaster Recovery Strategy

-   **Law**: DR (Disaster Recovery) strategy MUST select appropriate DR methods per tier based on RTO/RPO defined in BIA (§3).
-   **DR Tier Classification**:

    | DR Tier | Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost | Use Case |
    |:--------|:---------|:----|:----|:-----|:---------|
    | **Tier 0: Active-Active** | Multi-region simultaneous operation | ≈ 0 | ≈ 0 | Highest | Mission Critical |
    | **Tier 1: Hot Standby** | DR environment always running and synced | ≦ 15 min | ≦ 5 min | High | Business Critical |
    | **Tier 2: Warm Standby** | DR environment scaled down, periodic sync | ≦ 1 hour | ≦ 15 min | Medium | Important |
    | **Tier 3: Pilot Light** | Minimal configuration in DR environment | ≦ 4 hours | ≦ 1 hour | Low | General |
    | **Tier 4: Backup & Restore** | Restore from backup only | ≦ 24 hours | ≦ 24 hours | Lowest | Non-Critical |

-   **RPO/RTO Design Verification Checklist**:
    - **RPO**: How much data loss is acceptable
    - **RTO**: Maximum time to recovery after downtime
    - **MTPD (Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption)**: Maximum downtime the business can sustain
    - These values MUST be consistent with BIA results

### §14. Cloud-Native DR

-   **Law**: Cloud-environment DR requires different approaches than traditional on-premises DR. Maximize utilization of IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and cloud-native services.

-   **Multi-Region Failover**:
    - Cross-region replication utilization (DB, object storage)
    - DNS-based failover (Route 53 Health Check, Cloudflare Load Balancing, etc.)
    - Data consistency guarantee during failover (pre-define eventual consistency tolerance)

-   **IaC DR (Infrastructure as Code DR)**:
    - Define all infrastructure in code, maintaining **instant re-creation capability in another region**
    - Establish Terraform/Pulumi/OpenTofu state file backup and restoration procedures
    - **Recovery Playbook**: Document IaC-based environment rebuild procedures in runbooks

-   **Serverless / Edge Computing DR**:
    - Multi-region auto-deployment of serverless functions
    - Natural redundancy via Edge Functions global distribution
    - Failover design considering cold start latency

-   **DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service)**:
    - Maintain minimal resources in DR environment using Pilot Light strategy
    - Auto-scale-up upon failover
    - Monthly failover testing

-   **Container/Kubernetes DR**:
    - Instant deployment to alternative cluster via GitOps management of K8s Manifests
    - Persistent Volume cross-region snapshots
    - Utilization of backup tools (Velero, etc.)

-   **Multi-Cloud DR** (detailed in §39):
    - Assessment of single cloud provider dependency risk
    - Design and verification of cross-cloud failover

-   **Cross-Reference**: `engineering/510_aws_cloud.md` (Multi-Region), `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §7 (RPO/RTO), §39 (Multi-Cloud DR)

### §15. Data Protection & Backup Strategy

-   **Law**: Backup "creation" alone is insufficient. The ability to "restore" MUST be regularly verified. Unverified backups are considered **non-existent**.
-   **3-2-1-1 Backup Rule**:
    - **3**: Maintain at least **3** copies of data
    - **2**: Store on **2** different storage media types
    - **1**: Keep **1** off-site (different region/different provider)
    - **1**: Maintain **1** as immutable (tamper-proof) backup

-   **Immutable Backup Mandate**:
    - Counter the risk of ransomware encrypting backups
    - Utilize Object Lock (S3), WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage
    - Maintain a state where **deletion/modification is physically impossible** during retention period

-   **Backup Verification**:
    - **Monthly**: Automated restore test execution (see `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §10.3)
    - **Quarterly**: Manual full restore drill (Fire Drill Protocol)
    - **Verification Items**: Restore completion, table count match, row count integrity, application startup confirmation

-   **Backup Encryption**:
    - Encrypt all backups with AES-256 or higher
    - Store encryption keys **separately** from backups (KMS recommended)
    - **Crypto Agility**: Design for switchable encryption algorithms in preparation for PQC migration (see §35)

-   **Cross-Reference**: `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §7 (Fire Drill Protocol, Off-Site Backup), §10.3 (Automated Backup Verification)

---

## Part VIII: Exercises & Verification

### §16. Tabletop Exercises & GameDay

-   **Law**: Plans cannot be trusted without verification through exercises. Conduct regular tabletop exercises and GameDays to continuously improve response capabilities.

-   **Tabletop Exercise**:

    | Item | Criteria |
    |:-----|:--------|
    | **Frequency** | At least quarterly |
    | **Participants** | Incident response team + executives |
    | **Scenario** | Select from high-risk items in §4 risk assessment |
    | **Deliverables** | Discovered issues, improvement action list |
    | **Recording** | Record entire exercise process for next cycle improvement |

-   **Recommended Scenarios**:
    - Full system encryption by ransomware
    - Cloud provider region outage
    - Data leak via insider threat
    - Supply chain attack (compromised dependency package)
    - Simultaneous DDoS + ransomware (multi-vector attack)
    - AI API runaway / cost explosion
    - Company-wide remote transition due to pandemic
    - Zero-day vulnerability disclosure (critical vulnerability in used OSS)
    - Regulatory authority reporting drill (DORA/NIS2 reporting timeline compliance)

-   **GameDay (Chaos Engineering Integration)**:
    - Intentional fault injection in **staging environment**
    - Utilize tools like ChaosMesh/Gremlin/Litmus
    - Announced → Unannounced → Production (gradually expand based on maturity)
    - **Success Criteria**: Auto-recovery functions correctly, recovery within RTO

-   **Post-Exercise Improvement Cycle**:
    1.  Review exercise results (catalogue discovered issues)
    2.  Create improvement action items (assign owner and deadline)
    3.  Confirm improvements completed before next exercise
    4.  Reflect improvements in runbooks and BCP

-   **Cross-Reference**: `operations/400_site_reliability.md` §1 (Chaos Engineering), `quality/000_qa_testing.md` Part VIII (Resilience Testing), §38 (Advanced Exercise Programs)

### §17. Runbook Framework

-   **Law**: Create specific procedure guides (runbooks) for major failure scenarios **in advance**. Incident response without runbooks is "groping fire-fighting" that significantly extends recovery time.
-   **Runbook Template**:

    | Step | Content | Estimated Duration |
    |:-----|:--------|:-----------------:|
    | **1. Confirm** | Verify incident occurrence (status page, monitoring) | 5 min |
    | **2. Diagnose** | Root cause isolation (metrics, log review) | 15 min |
    | **3. Declare** | Incident declaration, War Room setup decision | 5 min |
    | **4. Mitigate** | Reduce impact scope (config change, resource scaling, Kill Switch) | 15 min |
    | **5. Alternate** | Switch to fallback (redundancy, alternative service) | 30 min |
    | **6. Notify** | Status page, user notification | 10 min |
    | **7. Recover** | Restore to normal state | Variable |
    | **8. Verify** | Normal operation confirmation test | 15 min |
    | **9. Document** | Begin Post-Mortem creation | — |

-   **Required Runbooks (Minimum Coverage)**:

    | Scenario | Primary Response |
    |:---------|:----------------|
    | **Database Failure** | Connection pool exhaustion, replica failover, backup restore |
    | **CDN/Media Delivery Failure** | Cache purge, direct delivery switchover, alternative CDN |
    | **Payment System Failure** | Maintenance banner, unprocessed transaction reconciliation |
    | **Auth Infrastructure Failure** | Session management fallback, emergency auth bypass |
    | **Cloud Region Outage** | Multi-region failover procedure |
    | **Ransomware Infection** | See §7.1 Playbook |
    | **Data Breach** | See §7.2 Protocol |
    | **DDoS Attack** | See §7.3 Response |
    | **AI API Failure/Runaway** | Kill Switch activation, alternative model switchover |
    | **Zero-Day Vulnerability** | See §7.5 Response |
    | **Regulatory Reporting** | See §34 Reporting Timeline Response |

-   **Runbook Quality Standards**:
    - **Executable**: Unambiguous procedures that can be executed by a first-time engineer
    - **Tested**: Verified through tabletop exercises or GameDays
    - **Current**: Reviewed quarterly, reflecting architecture changes
    - **Accessible**: Stored in a location accessible during production incidents (not dependent on production infrastructure)
    - **Versioned**: Under Git management with trackable change history

-   **Cross-Reference**: §5 (Incident Response), §13 (DR Strategy), §16 (Tabletop Exercises)

---

## Part IX: Post-Incident

### §18. Post-Mortem & Continuous Improvement

-   **Law (Blameless Post-Mortem Protocol)**: Assigning individual blame during incidents is **strictly prohibited**. Ask not "why did they make a mistake" but "why did the system allow them to make a mistake."

-   **Post-Mortem Requirements**:

    | Level | Post-Mortem | Deadline |
    |:------|:-----------|:---------|
    | **SEV-1** | Required (all participants) | Within 48 hours |
    | **SEV-2** | Required (stakeholders) | Within 72 hours |
    | **SEV-3** | Recommended | Within 1 week |
    | **SEV-4** | Optional | — |

-   **5 Whys (Root Cause Analysis)**:
    - Repeat "Why?" five times to reach the true Root Cause
    - **"Human error" is not a cause — it is the starting point of investigation**
    - Root Cause MUST always be a "deficiency in systems, processes, or tools"

-   **Post-Mortem Required Sections**:

    | Section | Content |
    |:--------|:--------|
    | **Summary** | What happened (1-2 sentences) |
    | **Timeline** | Chronological: occurrence → detection → initial response → resolution (timestamped) |
    | **Impact Scope** | Affected user count, impact duration, data loss status |
    | **Root Cause** | 5 Whys result (code change, config error, external dependency, etc.) |
    | **Detection Evaluation** | Analysis of detection method and time (TTD: Time to Detect) |
    | **Response Evaluation** | Analysis of response appropriateness and time (TTM: Time to Mitigate) |
    | **Improvement Actions** | Recurrence prevention measures (specific tasks, owners, deadlines) |
    | **Lessons Learned** | Content to append to project lessons log |
    | **Regulatory Response Review** | Regulatory reporting obligation compliance status (if applicable) |

-   **Completion Criteria (Systemic Fix Mandate)**:
    - Post-mortem completion requires submission of a PR that **physically prevents** recurrence through one of:
      - **New automated test** addition
      - **Lint rule** addition
      - **Monitoring alert** creation/threshold adjustment
      - **Architecture change** implementation
    - **"Being more careful" or "updating the manual" are NOT accepted as countermeasures**

-   **Metrics Tracking**:

    | Metric | Definition | Target |
    |:-------|:----------|:-------|
    | **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)** | Average time from failure to detection | ≦ 5 min |
    | **MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)** | Average time from detection to initial response | ≦ 15 min |
    | **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve)** | Average time from failure to recovery | ≦ 1 hour (SEV-1) |
    | **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)** | Average time between failures | Maintain upward trend |
    | **Recurrence Rate** | Recurrence rate of same Root Cause | 0% (zero recurrence) |

## Part X: Governance & Maturity

### §19. Crisis Management Governance

-   **Law**: Crisis management is not solely the responsibility of the engineering team — it MUST be operated as an organization-wide governance framework.
-   **RACI Matrix**:

    | Activity | CTO/VP | Engineering Manager | SRE/DevOps | Product | Legal |
    |:---------|:------:|:------------------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-----:|

-   **Budget & Investment**:
    - Secure a clear annual budget for crisis management
    - Justify tool investments (monitoring, backup, DRaaS, etc.) from a cost avoidance perspective
    - **ROI Calculation**: Compare past incident costs (downtime cost + reputation impact) against countermeasure costs

-   **KPIs**:

    | KPI | Target | Review Frequency |
    |:----|:------|:----------------:|
    | BCP Update Frequency | At least annually | Annual |

    2.  **Phase 2 (Recommend)**: AI recommends response procedures, provides auto-links to runbooks
    3.  **Phase 3 (Autonomous)**: Auto-remediation for low-risk patterns (with Guardrails)

-   **Guardrails**:
    - **Allowed scope for automated remediation**: Only permit auto-remediation for known patterns of SEV-3/4
    - **SEV-1/2 prohibition**: Automated response for critical incidents is **prohibited** (human judgment required)
    - **Rollback**: Immediate rollback mechanism when automated remediation fails
    - **Audit logging**: Complete audit log recording of all AI decisions and actions
    - **Explainability**: Operators must be able to verify the rationale behind AI decisions

-   **Agentic AI & AI SOC Co-pilot (2025-2026 Trends)**:

    - **Self-Healing Systems**: Gartner prediction (60%+ of large enterprises will adopt AIOps-based self-healing systems by 2026)
    - **Adoption Principle**: Agentic AI must strictly follow the progression of "assist → recommend → autonomous" with sufficient safety verification at each stage before advancing

-   **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) Integration**:
    - **Definition**: Integrate SOAR as the orchestration layer for AIOps, building automated workflows for detection → triage → response → recovery
    - **SOAR Playbook Design Principles**:
        - 1:1 mapping between detection rules and Playbooks (alerts without corresponding Playbooks are elimination candidates)
        - Human-in-the-loop gates in each Playbook (full automation only for SEV-3/4 known patterns)
        - Playbook version control and testing (Playbook validation in CI/CD pipelines)
    - **SOAR Utilization Metrics**:

        | Metric | Definition | Target |
        |:-------|:----------|:-------|
        | **Playbook Automation Rate** | Playbook-handled incidents / total incidents | ≧ 60% |
        | **MTTR Reduction Rate** | MTTR comparison before/after SOAR deployment | ≧ 50% reduction |
        | **False Positive Reduction Rate** | False positive comparison before/after SOAR | ≧ 70% reduction |

## Part XLII: Cloud-Native Incident Response

### §52. Cloud-Native Incident Response

-   **Law**: Cloud-native environments such as containers, serverless, and microservice architectures present unique challenges that traditional incident response approaches cannot adequately address. Establish IR protocols specialized for cloud-native environments.

-   **Cloud-Native IR Unique Challenges**:

    | Challenge | Traditional Environment | Cloud-Native Environment |
    |:---------|:----------------------|:------------------------|
    | **Ephemeral Workloads** | Persistent servers | Containers disappear in seconds to minutes, logs and evidence vanish |
    | **Forensics Difficulty** | Disk imaging possible | Container filesystem is volatile, runtime memory dumps difficult |
    | **Lateral Movement Speed** | Network segment level | High-speed propagation via East-West communication between microservices |
    | **Visibility Gaps** | OS/network layer monitorable | Container runtime/service mesh layer monitoring may be insufficient |

-   **Container Forensics**:
    - **Runtime Security**: Container runtime monitoring via Falco, Sysdig, Aqua, etc.
    - **Image Preservation**: Snapshot preservation of compromised container images (as evidence)
    - **Log Persistence**: Immediate transfer of container logs to external storage (before container termination)
    - **Sidecar Forensics**: Pre-deployment of forensics sidecar containers (Kubernetes environments)

-   **Serverless IR**:
    - Preservation of function execution logs for Lambda/Cloud Functions etc.
    - Detection of anomalous initialization processing during cold starts
    - Function-level IAM permission auditing (identifying over-permissions)
    - Visualization of lateral movement paths in serverless environments

## Part XLIII: Polycrisis Response

### §53. Polycrisis Response Framework

-   **Law**: The 2025-2026 crisis landscape sees an increase in **Polycrisis** — situations where multiple crises occur simultaneously or in cascading fashion. Establish a framework for triage and resource allocation against simultaneous multi-crisis scenarios, beyond individual incident response.

-   **Polycrisis Scenario Examples**:
    - Ransomware attack + simultaneous cloud provider outage (DR environment unavailable)
    - Data breach + pandemic-caused staffing shortage + regulatory investigation
    - DDoS attack + supply chain attack + media scandal
    - Natural disaster + cyber attack (disaster-opportunistic attack)

-   **Multi-Crisis Triage Matrix**:

    | Priority | Criteria | Action |
    |:---------|:---------|:-------|
    | **P0: Safety** | Crisis involving human life/physical safety | Top priority, concentrate all resources |
    | **P1: Service** | Mission-critical service outage | Immediate response after Safety secured |
    | **P2: Data** | Risk of data breach/loss | Prioritize containment, recovery can wait |
    | **P3: Reputation** | Impact on brand/trust | Communication response, parallel with technical response |
    | **P4: Compliance** | Regulatory reporting obligations | Comply with statutory deadlines, parallel with other responses |

-   **Resource Allocation Principles**:
    - **Dual Incident Commander Model**: In multi-crisis situations, cognitive load is excessive for a single IC. Appoint ICs for each major incident with a Unified IC above
    - **Priority-Based Resource Allocation**: Concentrate all specialists on P0/P1, minimum staffing for P2 and below focused on containment
    - **Communication Separation**: Separate communication leads for each crisis to prevent information cross-contamination
    - **Decision-Making Under Incomplete Information**: Training for "sufficient information" decision-making without waiting for complete information (§50 Fog of War)

-   **Cross-Reference**: §5 (War Room), §50 (War Game), §45 (Alert Optimization)

    4.  **Phased Recovery**: Canary group → region-by-region → full deployment rolling recovery
    5.  **Physical Recall**: Physical device recall process for devices that cannot be recovered remotely

-   **Prevention Measures**:
    - Device certificate-based authentication (hardcoded secret keys prohibited)
    - Secure boot mandatory
    - Device lifecycle management (planned EOL/EOS device updates)
    - Network segmentation (separation of IoT and corporate networks)

-   **Cross-Reference**: §36 (OT/ICS), §52 (Cloud-Native IR)

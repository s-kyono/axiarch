## Part I: Foundation & Philosophy

### §1. SRE Core Principles

-   **Law (Service Reliability Hierarchy)**: The purpose of SRE is not to make systems unbreakable, but to build mechanisms that recover quickly from failures and prevent the same failure from recurring.

    | Layer | Content | Example |
    |:------|:--------|:--------|
    | **1. Monitoring** | Know what is happening | Metrics, Logs, Traces |
    | **2. Incident Response** | Respond quickly to problems | On-call, Runbooks |
    | **3. Post-mortem** | Understand root cause & prevent recurrence | Blameless Post-mortem |
    | **4. Testing & Release** | Prevent failures from changes | Canary, Load testing |
    | **5. Capacity Planning** | Prepare for future demand | Resource forecasting |
    | **6. Development** | Build reliability into design | SLO-driven development |
    | **7. Product** | Deliver reliability as user experience | Error budget-driven decisions |

-   **6 Core Principles**:
    1.  **Hope is not a strategy** — "It probably won't break" is not a strategy. Verify all assumptions
    2.  **Embrace risk** — Don't eliminate risk; quantify and manage it (Error Budget philosophy)
    3.  **Eliminate toil** — Systematically eliminate repetitive, manual, automatable work
    4.  **Move fast, don't break things** — Speed and reliability are not mutually exclusive. Achieve both with SLOs and error budgets
    5.  **Measure everything** — You can't improve what you can't measure
    6.  **Slow is the New Down** — A technically "up" but slow service IS an outage. Prioritize P99 tail latency

-   **The 50% Rule**: SRE engineers MUST spend at most 50% of their time on operations (including Toil). The remaining 50%+ must be dedicated to engineering (automation & improvement).

### §2. SRE Role & Scope

-   **Scope of This Rule (52)**:

    | Domain | This Rule (52) | Delegated To |
    |:-------|:-------------|:------------|
    | SLI/SLO/Error Budgets | ✅ Definition & operation | — |
    | Observability & Monitoring | ✅ Design & operation | — |
    | Deployment Strategy | ✅ CD/Progressive Delivery | 30 (CI/CD details) |
    | Chaos Engineering | ✅ Design & operation | 70 (Testing strategy) |
    | Incident Response (details) | Overview & SRE-specific metrics | 53 (Crisis Management) |
    | BCP/DR (details) | RPO/RTO overview & Fire Drill | 53 (Crisis Management) |
    | Security | Observability & audit logs | 60 (Security & Privacy) |
    | Performance | ✅ Benchmarks & load testing | — |
    | FinOps | ✅ SRE-perspective cost management | — |
    | Capacity Planning | ✅ Resource forecasting & saturation | — |
    | Toil Management | ✅ Definition, measurement & reduction | — |
    | Platform Engineering | ✅ IDP foundation principles | — |
    | Production Readiness Review | ✅ Review process | — |

### §3. Evolution of SRE as Reliability Architect

-   **Law**: Post-2025 SREs are not mere "server operators" but "architects of reliability," embedded across teams and systems to ensure reliability from the design phase.
-   **SRE in the AI Era**: SRE responsibility extends to model performance monitoring, inference latency SLOs, GPU capacity planning, and similar domains.

---

## Part II: SLI / SLO / SLA

### §4. SLI Design Principles

-   **Law**: SLIs (Service Level Indicators) MUST directly reflect **user experience**. Internal metrics (CPU usage, etc.) are NOT SLIs but supporting indicators for root cause investigation.
-   **4 SLI Selection Principles**:
    1.  **User-centric**: Measure what users actually experience
    2.  **Measurable**: Automatically and continuously measurable
    3.  **Actionable**: Concrete actions can be taken when thresholds are exceeded
    4.  **Ratio-based**: Expressed as "good events / total events"

-   **SLI Category Templates**:

    | Category | SLI Definition | Measurement Method |
    |:---------|:-------------|:------------------|
    | **Availability** | Successful requests / Total requests | Load balancer logs |
    | **Latency** | Requests within threshold / Total requests | P50/P95/P99 distribution |
    | **Quality** | Error-free responses / Total responses | Application logs |
    | **Freshness** | Data updated within threshold / All data | Data pipeline logs |
    | **Correctness** | Requests with correct results / Total requests | Quality monitoring |
    | **Throughput** | Completed tasks / Submitted tasks | Job queue metrics |
    | **Durability** | Period without data loss / Total period | Storage monitoring |

### §5. SLO Definition & OpenSLO

-   **Law**: SLOs MUST be defined at project inception and reviewed monthly. SLOs are "targets" not "promises"; decisions are driven by error budget burn rate.
-   **SLO Design Template**:

    | Service Category | SLI (Indicator) | SLO (Target) | Measurement |
    |:----------------|:---------------|:-------------|:-----------|
    | **Overall Uptime** | Success requests / Total | ≧ 99.9% (≦43min/month downtime) | UptimeRobot / Analytics |
    | **Primary API** | P95 Response Time | ≦ 200ms | Canonical Log Line aggregation |
    | **Primary API** | P99 Response Time | ≦ 500ms | Tail latency monitoring |
    | **Detail Page API** | P95 Response Time | ≦ 300ms | Canonical Log Line aggregation |
    | **Static Assets** | P95 TTFB | ≦ 100ms | CDN Analytics |
    | **AI Response** | P95 Response Time | ≦ 3000ms | AI FinOps Dashboard |
    | **Error Rate** | 5xx Response ratio | ≦ 0.1% | Error tracking + Server Logs |

-   **OpenSLO Compliance**: SLO definitions MUST be managed declaratively using the **OpenSLO specification** (YAML). Vendor-neutral, CI-validated.

    ```yaml
    # openslo.yaml — OpenSLO specification-compliant SLO definition
    apiVersion: openslo/v1
    kind: SLO
    metadata:
      name: api-availability
      displayName: "Primary API Availability"
    spec:
      service: api-gateway
      description: "Primary API availability SLO"
      budgetingMethod: Occurrences
      objectives:
        - displayName: "99.9% Availability"
          target: 0.999
          timeWindow:
            - duration: 30d
              isRolling: true
      indicator:
        metadata:
          name: api-availability-sli
        spec:
          ratioMetric:
            good:
              metricSource:
                type: prometheus
                spec:
                  query: sum(rate(http_requests_total{code!~"5.."}[5m]))
            total:
              metricSource:
                type: prometheus
                spec:
                  query: sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
    ```

-   **SLO Controller**: In Kubernetes environments, deploy SLO Controllers to auto-generate alert rules and dashboards from SLO definitions.
-   **Review Cadence**: Monthly review of SLI/SLO achievement with threshold adjustments.
-   **Status Page**: Maintain an external status page with automated SLO integration. Concealing outages is "death of trust."

### §6. SLA Management & Legal Considerations

-   **Law**: SLAs MUST be set **more conservatively** than SLOs. SLAs carry legal binding force with penalties for violations.
-   **SLO → SLA Conversion**: `SLA ≦ SLO - margin` (e.g., SLO 99.9% → SLA 99.5%)
-   **Planned Maintenance**: 72-hour advance notice mandatory; ensure contractual exclusion from SLA calculations.

### §7. External Dependency SLO Integration

-   **Law**: System-wide SLO cannot exceed the SLO of its dependencies (**SLO Chain Rule**).
-   **Dependency SLI**: Define SLIs per external service (payment API, email, CDN, etc.) and visualize on dependency maps.
-   **Composite SLO Calculation**: `System SLO ≦ min(Service_A_SLO × Service_B_SLO × ...)`
-   **Fallback Design**: Pre-define fallback strategies for external dependency SLO violations.

---

## Part III: Error Budgets

### §8. Error Budget Fundamentals

-   **Law**: Error budgets quantify "the allowable amount of unreliability." If SLO is 99.9%, the monthly error budget is 0.1% (~43 minutes).
-   **Tiered Error Budget Policy**:

    | Error Budget Remaining | State | Action |
    |:----------------------|:------|:-------|
    | **> 50%** | Healthy | Continue normal feature development |
    | **25-50%** | Caution | Postpone risky releases. Run reliability improvements in parallel |
    | **5-25%** | Warning | Feature Freeze. Focus on reliability improvements |
    | **< 5%** | Danger | **Dedicate all resources to reliability**. Executive reporting mandatory |
    | **0% (Exhausted)** | Exhausted | Prohibit all deployments except reliability fixes |

### §9. Multi-Window / Multi-Burn-Rate Alerting

-   **Law**: Monitor error budget burn rate across **multiple time windows** to minimize false positives while detecting critical consumption instantly.

    | Window | Burn Rate Threshold | Alert Level | Meaning |
    |:-------|:-------------------|:-----------|:--------|
    | **1h / 5m** | > 14.4 | **P0 (Immediate)** | Consuming 1 day's budget in 1 hour |
    | **6h / 30m** | > 6.0 | **P1 (1 hour)** | Consuming 1 day's budget in 6 hours |
    | **1d / 2h** | > 3.0 | **P2 (4 hours)** | Slow but sustained consumption |
    | **3d / 6h** | > 1.0 | **Ticket** | Trend monitoring, create ticket |

-   **Rationale**: Single-window alerting biases toward either false positives or missed detections. Follows the Google SRE Workbook Multi-Window approach.

---

## Part IV: Observability Foundation

### §10. Five Pillars: Metrics, Logs, Traces, Events, Profiles

-   **Law**: Observability consists of **Metrics, Logs, Traces, Events, and Profiles**. Continuous Profiling is positioned as the 5th pillar.

    | Pillar | Purpose | Examples |
    |:-------|:--------|:--------|
    | **Metrics** | Numerical data for trend analysis & alerting | CPU usage, RPS, Error rate |
    | **Logs** | Detailed event records for debugging | Request logs, Error logs |
    | **Traces** | Request path tracking for bottleneck identification | Distributed tracing |
    | **Events** | State change records for change tracking | Deploys, Config changes, Scaling |
    | **Profiles** | Detailed resource consumption analysis | CPU/Memory/Lock profiling |

-   **Golden Signals (4 Key Signals)**: Monitor the following with highest priority for all services:
    1.  **Latency**: P50/P95/P99. Prioritize P99 tail latency
    2.  **Traffic**: Demand on the system (RPS, etc.)
    3.  **Errors**: Ratio of failed requests
    4.  **Saturation**: Resource utilization

### §11. OpenTelemetry Integration & Pipeline Architecture

-   **Law**: Use **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** as the industry standard for observability instrumentation. Direct dependency on vendor-specific SDKs is prohibited.
-   **OTel Adoption Principles**:
    1.  **Vendor-neutral instrumentation**: Use only OTel SDK in applications. Connect backends via OTel Collector
    2.  **Auto-instrumentation**: Maximize auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation only where necessary
    3.  **Semantic Conventions**: Follow OTel Semantic Conventions (`http.request.method`, `db.system`, etc.)
    4.  **Sampling Strategy**: Head-based / Tail-based sampling for cost management

-   **OpAMP (Open Agent Management Protocol)**: Remote management protocol for OTel Collectors. Enables centralized configuration management, dynamic updates, and health monitoring for large-scale Collector fleets. Recommended as the standard for fleet management.

-   **OTel Collector Deployment Patterns**:

    | Pattern | Configuration | Use Case |
    |:--------|:-------------|:---------|
    | **Agent** | Sidecar/DaemonSet per node | Low latency, local buffering |
    | **Gateway** | Centralized aggregation gateway | Routing, filtering, sampling |
    | **Agent + Gateway** | Two-tier architecture | Recommended for large-scale environments |

    ```yaml
    # otel-collector-config.yaml — OTel Collector Gateway configuration example
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
    processors:
      batch:

        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlphttp]
    ```

### §12. eBPF-Based Observability

-   **Law**: For kernel-level high-precision observability, use **eBPF**-based tooling. Instrumentation without application code changes.
-   **Use Cases**:
    1.  **Network Observability**: TCP retransmissions, connection latency, DNS resolution time
    2.  **Application Profiling**: Function-level CPU/memory usage (no code changes)
    3.  **Security Monitoring**: Syscall monitoring, anomalous process detection
    4.  **Performance Analysis**: I/O latency, scheduler latency
-   **Tooling**: Grafana Beyla (auto-instrumentation), Cilium Hubble (network), bpftrace, Pixie
-   **Note**: eBPF requires Linux kernel 5.10+. Verify availability in managed Kubernetes environments.

### §12-b. OTel CI/CD Observability

-   **Law**: Treat CI/CD pipelines themselves as observability targets. Instrument each stage (build/test/deploy) with OTel traces.
-   **OTel CI/CD Observability SIG (2025-2026)**:
    1.  **Pipeline Traces**: Record all stages (build→test→deploy) as OTel spans. Ensure traceability for failure root causes
    2.  **Test Execution Metrics**: Auto-collect test execution time, flaky test rate, test coverage via OTel metrics
    3.  **Deploy Correlation**: Auto-correlate deploy events with SLI changes. Instantly detect deploy-caused SLI degradation
    4.  **Semantic Conventions for CI/CD**: Use standard attributes: `cicd.pipeline.name`, `cicd.pipeline.run.id`, `cicd.task.type`

    ```yaml
    # CI/CD OTel instrumentation concept example (GitHub Actions)
    # Send build metrics via OTel Collector
    env:
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://collector.example.com:4317"
      OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "ci-pipeline"
      OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES: "cicd.pipeline.name=main-build,deployment.environment=ci"
    ```

-   **OTel Logs GA (2025)**: OTel Logs signal promoted to Stable (GA). Unified log collection via OTel SDK recommended. Phase out vendor-specific Log Agents.

---

## Part V: Structured Logging & Canonical Log Lines

### §13. Structured Logging

-   **Law**: All logs MUST be output in **JSON format (structured logging)**. Plaintext logs are prohibited.
-   **Log Level Standard**:
    -   `error`: Exceptions, unrecoverable states — Always enabled in production
    -   `warn`: Deprecated usage, performance concerns — Always enabled in production
    -   `info`: Important business events — Always enabled in production
    -   `debug`: Development details — **Disabled** in production
-   **Canonical Log Lines**: Output a single aggregated log line at request completion.

    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-03-19T00:00:00Z",
      "level": "info",
      "msg": "request_completed",
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/api/stores/123",
      "status": 200,
      "duration_ms": 45,
      "db_queries": 3,
      "cache_hit": true,
      "request_id": "req_abc123",
      "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
      "user_id": "usr_xyz"
    }
    ```

### §14. Log Pipeline Reliability

-   **Law**: Log loss means "operating blind." Guarantee the reliability of the log pipeline itself.
-   **Requirements**:
    1.  **Backpressure Control**: Buffer when log generation exceeds processing speed. Sample when buffer limit is reached
    2.  **Log Loss Detection**: Detect sequence number or heartbeat gaps and trigger alerts
    3.  **Dead Letter Queue**: Route parse-error logs to DLQ instead of discarding
    4.  **Log Rotation**: Size/time-based rotation to prevent disk exhaustion
    5.  **Encrypted Transport**: TLS encryption mandatory for log transport

---

## Part VI: Distributed Tracing

### §15. Tracing Foundation

-   **Law**: Tag complex distributed transactions with `correlation_id` for end-to-end log traceability.
-   **Trace Context Propagation**: Propagate `traceparent` headers compliant with W3C Trace Context across all services.
-   **Outcome**: Maintain capability to identify "which request failed at which service at which step" within 60 seconds of failure.

### §16. Service Map & Dependency Visualization

-   **Law**: **Auto-generate service maps** from distributed trace data to visualize inter-service dependencies, latency, and error rates in real time.
-   **Applications**:
    1.  **Dependency Discovery**: Identify unknown dependencies and bottlenecks
    2.  **Change Impact Analysis**: Predict affected services before deployment
    3.  **Failure Propagation Tracking**: Visualize cascade failure propagation paths

### §17. Request ID / Health Check Protocol

-   **Request ID Protocol**: All API responses MUST include `x-request-id` in both response headers and error JSON bodies.
-   **Health Check Protocol**: All applications MUST expose `/api/health` or `/healthz`.
    -   **Liveness**: Is the process alive? (restart decision)
    -   **Readiness**: Can it accept traffic? (routing decision)
    -   **Startup**: Has initialization completed? (prevent premature kills)

---

## Part VII: Continuous Profiling

### §18. Continuous Profiling Principles

-   **Law**: Continuous Profiling is the **5th pillar** of observability. Continuously collect profiles in production to identify performance bottlenecks at the code level.
-   **Collection Targets**:

    | Profile Type | Purpose | Tooling |
    |:------------|:--------|:--------|
    | **CPU** | Identify CPU-consuming functions | Pyroscope, Parca |
    | **Memory (Heap)** | Detect memory leaks & large allocations | Pyroscope, pprof |
    | **Goroutine/Thread** | Concurrency bottlenecks | Pyroscope |
    | **Lock/Mutex** | Lock contention detection | Pyroscope |
    | **Wall Clock** | Real elapsed time bottlenecks | Pyroscope |

-   **Low Overhead**: eBPF-based profilers maintain production overhead at 1-3%.
-   **Flame Graphs**: Visualize profile data as flame graphs for intuitive hotspot identification.
-   **Differential Analysis**: Compare pre/post-deployment profiles to auto-detect performance regressions.

---

## Part VIII: Frontend Observability

### §19. Frontend Monitoring

-   **Law**: Deploy **Sentry** or equivalent for monitoring frontend script errors (Uncaught Exceptions) and hydration errors.
-   **Scope**: Enabled only in production (`NODE_ENV=production`).
-   **RUM (Real User Monitoring)**: Collect CWV (LCP/INP/CLS) from real users and compare with synthetic monitoring.

### §20. Web Vitals SLO

-   **Law**: Define SLOs for Core Web Vitals and manage with error budgets.

    | Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
    |:-------|:-----|:-----------------|:-----|
    | **LCP** | ≦ 2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | > 4.0s |
    | **INP** | ≦ 200ms | 200-500ms | > 500ms |
    | **CLS** | ≦ 0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | > 0.25 |

-   **SLO Target**: Achieve "Good" at the 75th percentile. Track monthly via CrUX data.

---

## Part IX: PII Protection & Log Security

### §21. PII Protection

-   **Law**: Including PII (email, phone, tokens, etc.) in structured logs is **prohibited**.
-   **Action**:

## Part X: Alerting & Notification

### §22. SLO-Based Alerting

-   **Law**: Design alerts with **SLO-based** (error budget burn rate) alerting as primary, threshold-based as supplementary.
-   **Principle**: Prioritize symptom-based alerting. Limit cause-based alerting to dashboard visualization.

### §23. Quantitative Alert Threshold Standards

-   **The Alert Matrix**:

    | Metric | Warning | Critical | Response Action |
    |:-------|:--------|:---------|:---------------|
    | **Error Rate** (5xx) | > 1% (5min) | > 5% (5min) | Immediate investigation / rollback |
    | **P95 Response Time** | > 500ms | > 2000ms | Query optimization / cache review |
    | **P99 Response Time** | > 1000ms | > 5000ms | Tail latency investigation |
    | **DB Connection Pool** | > 70% | > 90% | Connection optimization |
    | **Memory Usage** | > 80% | > 95% | Memory leak investigation |
    | **Disk Usage** | > 70% | > 90% | Log rotation / expansion |

    2.  **Alert Grouping**: Aggregate multiple alerts from the same root cause
    3.  **Flapping Detection**: Auto-suppress alerts that toggle frequently
    4.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Quarterly alert audit. Remove alerts that never required action
    5.  **Alert 3 Requirements**: All alerts MUST be ① immediately actionable ② require human judgment ③ time-sensitive

### §25. Escalation Channel Matrix

| Severity | Notification Channel | Response Deadline | Example |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-----------------|:--------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Phone/SMS + Instant notification | **15 min** | Complete service outage, Data loss |
| **P1 (High)** | Instant notification + PagerDuty | **1 hour** | Major feature outage |

## Part XI: On-Call Design

### §26. On-Call Core Principles

-   **Law**: On-call is the backbone of SRE. Build a fair system that prevents burden concentration.
-   **Principles**:
    1.  **Rotation**: Fair rotation via PagerDuty (weekly recommended)
    2.  **Escalation**: Primary → 5-min no-response → Auto-escalate to Secondary
    3.  **Runbook Integration**: Pre-prepare runbooks for all P0/P1 alerts
    4.  **Compensation**: Appropriate compensation for on-call standby
    5.  **Load Limit**: If > 2 pages/day per shift, prioritize root cause improvement
    6.  **Handoff**: Create handoff documentation at shift transitions

### §27. On-Call Human Factors

-   **Law**: On-call MUST be sustainable. Apply human factors engineering.
-   **Design Requirements**:
    1.  **Minimize cognitive load**: Alerts must include "what's happening," "what to do," and "runbook link"
    2.  **Post-incident rest**: Guarantee minimum half-day recovery after SEV-1 response
    3.  **Page frequency tracking**: Monthly measurement of on-call "happiness" (night pages, response time)
    4.  **Shadow On-Call**: New members must shadow for minimum 2 weeks

-   **DORA 7 Archetypes (2025)**: DORA transitioned from 4-tier classification (Low/Medium/High/Elite) to **7 archetypes** (8-measure based). Multi-dimensional evaluation of team throughput, stability, and performance is recommended.
-   **DORA 7 Archetypes Detail**:

    | Archetype | Characteristics | Countermeasures |
    |:----------|:---------------|:---------------|
    | **Climate Champions** | All metrics Elite. High AI adoption | Share best practices across teams |
    | **Fast Movers** | High throughput / Medium stability | Invest in stability (test strengthening) |
    | **Balanced** | All metrics moderate | Identify bottlenecks → focused improvement |
    | **Slow but Steady** | Low throughput / High stability | CI/CD automation, increase deploy frequency |

    -   **Deliverables**: Timeline, root cause, impact scope, improvement actions (with owners & deadlines)
-   **5 Whys**: Don't stop at surface-level causes; drill down to systemic root causes.

### §31. Learning from Incidents (LFI)

-   **Law**: Incidents are not "failures" but "learning opportunities." Build organizational learning processes.
-   **LFI Framework**:
    1.  **Just Culture**: Focus on system improvement, not individual punishment. Exceptions: gross negligence or malice
    2.  **Incident Story Sharing**: Monthly anonymized incident story sharing across the organization
    3.  **Pattern Analysis**: Extract common patterns from multiple incidents for systemic improvement
    4.  **Action Item Tracking**: Track post-mortem action item completion rate. Target: 80% completed within 30 days
    5.  **Near-Miss Reporting**: Include near-misses (non-incidents) in reporting and analysis

### §32. Decomposition-Based Triage

-   **Law**: Post-large-change issues should use **incremental per-feature-group rollback** to identify minimum reproduction units, not wholesale rollback.
-   **Server Log Sovereignty**: Use server logs as primary information source. Categorize using HTTP status and error stacks.

---

## Part XIV: Deployment Strategy

### §33. Automated Deployment Mandate

-   **Law**: Production deployments MUST NEVER be performed via manual commands.
-   **Prohibition**: "Manual deployment" is an "engineering suicide act" that invites operational mistakes.
-   **Action**: Deployment is the automatic result of "verified code (PR)" passing through a "trusted pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.)."
-   **Pre-Deploy Gates**:
    1.  `tsc --noEmit` (type check) ✅
    2.  `npm run build` (build check) ✅
    3.  Automated tests passed ✅
    4.  Responsible person approval ✅

### §34. Branch Hygiene & Preview Environment Management

-   **Branch Hygiene**: "Delete after merge" is an engineer's reflex.
-   **Preview Environment Evacuation**: If migration inconsistency occurs in a preview environment, abandon immediately and create a new one instead of wasting time on repair.
-   **Gatekeeper**:
    -   **Linter Zero Tolerance**: `eslint --max-warnings=0` mandatory
    -   **Husky Guard**: Block direct pushes to `main`/`master` via `pre-push` hooks

    | **Canary** | Deploy to 1-5% of users first | Incremental risk detection | Feature releases |
    | **Feature Flag** | Decouple code deploy from release | Instant disable | All features |
    | **Shadow Traffic** | Mirror production traffic to new service | Lower-risk validation | Backend overhaul |
    | **Dark Launch** | Deploy feature invisibly, collect metrics | Performance validation | Major changes |

-   **SLO-Linked Rollback**: Auto-rollback if SLO violation detected during canary.

### §36. Feature Flag Reliability

-   **Law**: Feature Flags are powerful but unmanaged flags become technical debt.
-   **Feature Flag Lifecycle**:
    1.  **Creation**: Always set TTL (expiration). Recommended: max 90 days
    2.  **Operation**: Visualize flag states and impact on dashboards
    3.  **Retirement**: Remove flags and guard conditions from code after full rollout
-   **Stale Flag Detection**: Auto-detect flags unchanged for 90+ days and create cleanup tickets.

    1.  **Expand**: Add new columns/tables (no existing code impact)
    2.  **Migrate**: Move data to new structure
    3.  **Contract**: Remove old columns/tables (after all code migrated)

### §39. Rollback Criteria

| Metric | Threshold | Verdict |
|:-------|:---------|:--------|
| Error Rate (5xx) | > 5% (5min) | Immediate rollback |
| P95 Response Time | > 2000ms (10min) | Immediate rollback |

| **Timeout** | Prevent infinite waits | Set timeouts on all external calls. Default 10s |
| **Bulkhead** | Isolate failures | Separate resource pools by function |
| **Rate Limiting** | Prevent overload | Token Bucket / Sliding Window |
| **Fallback** | Default response on failure | Return cached data, limited functionality mode |
| **Backpressure** | Prevent upstream overload propagation | Reject requests when queues saturate |

### §45. Adaptive Capacity

    1.  **Graceful Stretch**: Under excessive load, gradually reduce quality while maintaining service
    2.  **Adaptive Throttling**: Dynamically adjust rate limits during traffic spikes
    3.  **Load Shedding**: Intentionally discard low-priority requests to protect high-priority ones during resource exhaustion

### §45-b. Adaptive Concurrency Limits

-   **Law**: Instead of static concurrency limits, adopt patterns that **dynamically adjust Concurrency Limits**.
-   **Principles**:
    1.  **Vegas Algorithm**: Inspired by TCP Vegas congestion control. Auto-reduce Concurrency Limit upon detecting latency increases
    2.  **Gradient Algorithm**: More responsive control based on the gradient (rate of increase) of latency
    3.  **Netflix Concurrency Limiter**: Reference implementation from Netflix OSS `concurrency-limits` library
-   **Use Cases**: API Gateways, inter-service communication, DB connection pools
-   **Benefits**: No manual tuning required. Auto-adapts to traffic pattern changes. Prevents cascade failures during overload.

## Part I: Primary Directive & AI Philosophy

### 1.1. Core Principles of AI Implementation

- **Rule 40.1**: AI features **assist** user decision-making; they do not **replace** it
- **Rule 40.2**: AI outputs are always "suggestions"; designs must ensure final judgment rests with humans
- **Rule 40.3**: AI feature failures must not halt the entire service (Graceful Degradation is mandatory)

### 1.2. AI Implementation Priority Hierarchy

| Priority | Domain | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **P0** | Safety | User safety, PII protection, harmful content blocking |
| **P1** | Reliability | Hallucination prevention, factual accuracy, source transparency |
| **P2** | UX | Response speed, conversation quality, accessibility |
| **P3** | Cost Efficiency | Token costs, infrastructure costs, ROI |
| **P4** | DX | Development speed, maintainability, testability |

### 1.3. AI First ≠ AI Only

- **Rule 40.4**: AI features must always have a **fallback** (non-AI alternative)
- Core business functions must continue when AI is unavailable
- Example: AI chat stops → automatically display FAQ/Help Center navigation

---

## Part II: AI UX Principles

### 2.1. Zero Latency Perception

- **Rule 40.5**: AI response wait time must be "perceived as zero." A loading spinner is a failure
- **Streaming First**: Display responses token-by-token in real-time without waiting for full server response
- **Instant Feedback**: Return UI changes within 100ms of user input

### 2.2. Optimistic UI

- **Instant Reaction**: The moment a user presses send, treat it as "successful" in the UI without waiting for AI processing
  - Immediate chat bubble display with in-progress indicator
- **Background Processing**: Actual processing runs in background. Notify user only on failure and prompt retry
- **Rollback Design**: Always implement UI state restoration mechanism for failed optimistic updates

### 2.3. State Visibility

- Always make transparent "what the AI is doing"
- Display staged statuses: `Thinking...`, `Searching...`, `Generating...`
- **Progress Granularity**: Use progress bars/step indicators for multi-step processes

### 2.4. AI Psychology (Satisfaction > Speed)

- **Thinking Visualization**: During extended processing, display animations visualizing the "thinking process" to convert wait time into "anticipation"
- **The High Cost Metaphor**: For rate limits, use value metaphors like "Daily Energy Limit" instead of "Limit reached" (stingy) → "Advanced energy exhausted" (value)
- **Confidence Indicator**: Visually display AI response confidence levels (high=green, medium=yellow, low=red dots)

### 2.5. Conversational UX Design Principles

- **Turn-Taking**: Display long AI responses in paragraph chunks, allowing users to interrupt or ask questions mid-stream
- **Context Awareness Badge**: When AI references past conversation context, indicate this with a badge/label
- **Error Recovery**: Use human-friendly expressions like "Please try again" instead of technical error messages
- **Undo/Regenerate**: Provide "Regenerate" and "Undo" options for all AI generations

---

## Part III: AI UX Pattern Catalog

### 3.1. Chat UI

- **Use Case**: Free-form Q&A, counseling, customer support
- **Required Elements**: Streaming display, message history, citation display, feedback (👍/👎), regenerate button
- **Prohibited**: Lazy loading of past messages via infinite scroll (initial load = latest N items, use pagination)

### 3.2. Copilot UI

- **Use Case**: Lateral assistance for user tasks (form input assistance, text proofreading, data analysis suggestions)
- **Design Principle**: Don't obstruct the main task. Display in side panel or inline suggestions
- **Accept/Reject**: Explicit accept/reject interactions for suggestions are mandatory
- **Learning Feedback**: Implement mechanisms to improve personalization from user accept/reject patterns

### 3.3. Agent UI

- **Use Case**: Multi-step autonomous task execution (data processing pipelines, research assistants)
- **Required Elements**: Step progress display, intermediate result preview, pause/resume controls
- **Human Checkpoint**: Always install human approval gates at critical decision points
- **Audit Trail**: Make all agent actions viewable and exportable as chronological logs

### 3.4. Ambient AI (Environmental Intelligence)

- **Use Case**: Runs in background, notifies only when needed (anomaly detection, proactive alerts)
- **Notification Strategy**: Control notification channels by severity (Critical=Push, Info=In-App Badge)
- **Opt-Out**: Always provide a toggle for users to completely stop Ambient AI

### 3.5. Proactive UI

- **Use Case**: Predict and suggest next actions based on user behavior patterns
- **Non-Intrusive**: Display suggestions via toasts/banners, not modals, to avoid interrupting workflow
- **Frequency Control**: Limit display frequency of identical suggestions to prevent "pushy AI"

---

## Part IV: AI Ethics Framework

### 4.1. Responsible AI Principles

- **Fairness**: Guarantee outputs free from bias against specific attributes (race, gender, age, region, category)
- **Transparency**: Explain AI decision rationale in a form users can understand
- **Explainability**: Maintain a level where "why this response" can be explained to non-technical people
- **Privacy**: Apply data minimization principles, processing only the minimum necessary information
- **Safety**: Block harmful content generation with multi-layered defense
- **Human-Centricity**: AI respects user autonomy, eliminating coercion, manipulation, and addictive design

### 4.2. AI Ethics Checklist (Mandatory Pre-Deployment)

| # | Check Item | Pass Criteria |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | PII transmission defense | PII transmission to external LLMs is technically blocked |

---

## Part X: AI Bias and Fairness

### 10.1. The Fairness Protocol (Bias Mitigation)

- **Rule 40.12**: Control via system prompt to prevent generating biased/discriminatory responses against specific attributes without statistical basis
- Monitor usage of bias-containing adjectives like "dangerous" or "inferior" and enforce neutral expressions

### 10.2. Model Selection Bias Assessment Checklist

| **Gender Bias** | Compare responses to gender-related questions | 0 stereotype expressions |

- **Frequency**: Quarterly + model switches
- **Cross-Reference**: AI Ethics Checklist (§IV)

---

## Part XI: AI Architecture Patterns

### 11.1. Private Relay & Execution Pattern

- **Rule 40.13**: Client exposure of API keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`) is strictly prohibited. All AI processing must go through Server Actions or Route Handlers (`process.env.KEY`)
- **No Direct Client Access**: Prohibit direct external LLM API calls from clients. Always route through server-side proxy

### 11.2. Inference Execution Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Latency | Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Edge Runtime** | Chat, real-time responses | Lowest | Medium |
| **Serverless Functions** | Batch processing, analysis | Medium | Low |
| **Edge Functions (Supabase)** | Async processing, heavy inference | High (acceptable) | Low |
| **On-Device AI** | Image recognition, voice recognition | Lowest | Zero (no API needed) |

### 11.3. Hybrid Architecture

- **Cloud + Edge Strategy**: Use On-Device for privacy-sensitive processing, Cloud LLM for accuracy-critical processing
- **Fallback Chain**: Implement staged fallback: Edge AI → Cloud AI → Cache → Static Response
- **Rule 40.14**: AI features must be designed for Graceful Degradation. Core service functions must continue when AI APIs are unavailable

---

## Part XII: Model Routing & Abstraction

### 12.1. The Model Router Protocol (Tiered Architecture)

- **Rule 40.15**: Hardcoding specific model IDs (e.g., `"gemini-1.5-flash"`) in code is prohibited
- **Abstraction Layer**: Always implement a router that calls models via `Tier` (e.g., `Tier.FAST`, `Tier.SMART`, `Tier.VISION`, `Tier.THINKING`)

```typescript
// ✅ Correct implementation
const response = await aiRouter.generate({
  tier: Tier.FAST,
  prompt: userMessage,
});

// ❌ Prohibited: Hardcoding
const response = await gemini("gemini-x.x-flash", userMessage); // Hardcoded model ID
```

### 12.2. Model Selection Criteria

| Tier | Use Case | Selection Criteria |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `Tier.FAST` | Chat, simple Q&A | Cost-optimal, low latency |
| `Tier.SMART` | Complex reasoning, analysis | High accuracy, context understanding |
| `Tier.THINKING` | Deep thinking tasks, code generation | Reasoning chains, step-by-step |
| `Tier.VISION` | Image analysis, OCR | Multimodal, instant recognition |
| `Tier.EMBEDDING` | Search, similarity computation | High-dimensional vectors, multilingual |

- **Current Standard**: Map each generation's "standard lightweight model" (the model with optimal cost-performance at that time) to `Tier.FAST`. Specific model IDs are managed in the project's Blueprint (configuration files) and are not fixed in this constitution.
- **Vision AI Standards**: Thinking models are unsuitable for instant recognition tasks (OCR, etc.). Use non-Thinking models for `Tier.VISION`

### 12.3. Fallback & A/B Routing

- **Provider Fallback**: Implement auto-switching to alternative provider on primary provider failure
- **A/B Routing**: Enable serving different models to a subset of users via Feature Flags
- **Latency-Based Routing**: Auto-downgrade to lower-cost, faster models when response time SLOs are exceeded

---

## Part XIII: Context Window Management

### 13.1. Token Optimization Strategy

- **Rule 40.16**: Never send infinite conversation history. Extract and send only important context
- **Summarization Strategy**: Auto-summarize conversations beyond N turns; send summary + raw text of recent N turns
- **Input Token Monitoring**: Continuously monitor prompt token count and remove unnecessary information

### 13.2. Context Management Patterns

| Strategy | Description | Recommended Case |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Sliding Window** | Retain only the most recent N turns | Casual chat |
| **Summarize + Recent** | Summarize old conversations + retain recent raw | Long sessions |
| **RAG-Augmented Context** | Search and insert relevant info on each turn | Knowledge base Q&A |
| **Hierarchical Context** | System → Domain → Session → Turn hierarchy | Agent tasks |

### 13.3. Token Budget Allocation

```
Total Context Window Budget:
├── System Prompt:     15-20% (fixed)
├── RAG Context:       30-40% (dynamic)
├── Conversation History: 20-30% (sliding)
├── User Input:        10-15% (latest turn)
└── Safety Buffer:     5-10% (margin)
```

---

## Part XIV: Structured Output & Function Calling

### 14.1. Structured Output

- **Rule 40.17**: Structure AI responses using JSON mode (Structured Output) whenever possible to prevent parse errors
- **Schema Definition**: Define response schemas with Zod or similar, automating validation

```typescript
// Structured Output with Zod Schema
const ResponseSchema = z.object({
  answer: z.string(),
  confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
  sources: z.array(z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    url: z.string().url(),
  })),
  category: z.enum(["factual", "opinion", "recommendation"]),
});
```

### 14.2. Function Calling / Tool Use

- **Use Case**: Pattern where AI invokes external tools (DB search, API calls, calculations, etc.)
- **Schema-Driven**: Define tools strictly with JSON Schema, ensuring type safety
- **Permission Control**: Set execution permission levels per tool; install Human Approval Gates for destructive operations (DELETE, etc.)
- **Timeout**: Set timeouts for each tool invocation to prevent infinite loops

### 14.3. Tool Use Design Principles

- **Least Privilege**: Restrict tools exposed to AI to the minimum necessary
- **Idempotency**: Design tool invocations to be idempotent (re-execution produces same results) wherever possible
- **Read-Write Separation**: Clearly separate read-only and write tools; add confirmation steps for write tools

---

## Part XV: Streaming Architecture

### 15.1. Streaming Protocol Selection

| Protocol | Use Case | Advantages | Constraints |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **SSE** | Chat, text generation | Simple, HTTP-compatible | Unidirectional |
| **WebSocket** | Real-time dialog, collaboration | Bidirectional, low latency | Complex connection management |
| **HTTP Streaming** | Large data transfer | Standard HTTP | Requires backpressure control |

### 15.2. Vercel AI SDK Integration

- **Rule 40.18**: Use **Vercel AI SDK (Streaming)** as standard for chat and dialog features; run on Edge Runtime when possible to avoid cold starts
- Leverage `useChat` / `useCompletion` hooks to simplify client-side streaming
- **Backpressure Control**: Implement control mechanisms for when client processing speed can't keep up with server send rate

### 15.3. Streaming UX Requirements

- **Progressive Rendering**: Mandate real-time rendering at the token level
- **Abort Control**: Always implement a "Stop" button allowing users to halt generation mid-stream
- **Markdown Progressive Rendering**: Design streaming Markdown parsing to prevent parse breakage at chunk boundaries

---

## Part XVI: Asynchronous AI Processing

### 16.1. Async Offload Pattern

- **Rule 40.19**: Offload heavy processing taking several seconds or more (e.g., image analysis) to **async queues** to avoid Vercel timeouts
- **Recommended Queues**: Supabase Edge Functions + pgmq, Inngest, Temporal

### 16.2. Async Processing Design

| Item | Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| **Timeout** | Set maximum execution time per process (default: 30s) |
| **Retry Policy** | Exponential backoff (max 3 retries), use idempotency keys |
| **Dead Letter Queue** | Define fallback processing for all retry failures |
| **Progress Notification** | Notify async processing progress via WebSocket/Polling |
| **Result Persistence** | Save results to DB/Storage, allow client polling retrieval |

---

## Part XVII: Semantic Caching

### 17.1. The Semantic Caching Protocol (pgvector Strategy)

- **Rule 40.20**: Recommend implementing similarity-search caching using `pgvector`
- **Similarity Threshold**: **≥ 0.95** (return cached responses only for near-exact match Q&As)
- **Effect**: Cost reduction + significant response time improvement + UX enhancement

### 17.2. Cache Hierarchy Design

| Cache Layer | TTL | Target |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Exact Match** | 24 hours | Exact-match Q&As |
| **Semantic Match** | 6 hours | Q&As with similarity ≥ 0.95 |
| **RAG Chunk Cache** | 1 hour | Frequently referenced document chunks |
| **Embedding Cache** | 7 days | Pre-computed embedding vectors |

### 17.3. Cache Invalidation

- Immediately invalidate corresponding chunk caches when source documents are updated
- Do not cache responses dependent on user-specific context
- Monitor cache hit rates and use as data for threshold tuning

---

## Part XVIII: AI Security

### 18.1. Prompt Injection Defense (Multi-Layer Model)

- **Layer 1 — Input Sanitization**:
  - Escape or remove control strings from user input (`###`, `````, `<|system|>`, `SYSTEM:`, etc.)
  - Limit input text maximum length (recommended: 2,000-4,000 characters), truncate excess

- **Layer 2 — Delimiter Strategy**:
  ```
  [SYSTEM INSTRUCTION - DO NOT MODIFY]
  {system_prompt}
  [END SYSTEM INSTRUCTION]

  [USER MESSAGE]
  {user_input}
  [END USER MESSAGE]
  ```

- **Layer 3 — Output Validation**:
  - System prompt leak detection (partial matching)
  - PII pattern detection and masking
  - Filtering of external URLs outside whitelist

- **Layer 4 — Anomaly Detection**:
  - Log suspected prompt injection inputs at `warn` level and notify administrators
  - Detect high-volume requests in short periods and apply rate limiting

### 18.2. PII Scrubbing

- **Rule 40.21**: Prompts sent to external LLMs must not contain personally identifiable information
- Execute masking via regex before sending (`[CONTACT_REMOVED]`, `[NAME_REMOVED]`)
- **Target PII**: Names, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, government IDs, etc.

### 18.3. API Key Management

- **No Client Exposure**: Exposing AI API keys with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is strictly prohibited
- **Rotation**: Rotate API keys every 90 days
- **Vault Integration**: Integrate with secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### 18.4. Grounding & Fact-Check Standards

- **Rule 40.22**: Facts such as store information and prices must be cross-referenced (Grounded) with confirmed DB data, and sources must be cited
- **Numeric Data Rule**: Numeric data (prices, distances, quantities) is permitted only from direct RAG source or DB citations. AI calculation/speculation is prohibited
- **RAG Source Absence Protocol**: When sources cannot be retrieved, auto-append "This information is for reference only. Accuracy is not guaranteed"

---

## Part XIX: RAG Foundation Design

### 19.1. RAG Pipeline Architecture

```
RAG Pipeline:
[Document Ingestion] → [Chunking] → [Embedding] → [Index Storage]
                                                         ↓
[User Query] → [Query Processing] → [Retrieval] → [Reranking] → [Context Assembly] → [LLM Generation] → [Output Validation]
```

### 19.2. The Triple Write RAG Protocol (Clean Data Source)

- **Rule 40.23**: RAG reference sources must use **"Triple Write plain-text synced data"** as mandated by the CMS Constitution (`34`)
- **Rationale**: Noisy data full of HTML tags wastes tokens and degrades response accuracy

### 19.3. Embedding Model Selection

| Criteria | Considerations |
|:---|:---|
| **Multilingual Support** | Must generate suitable embeddings for the target languages and locales |
| **Dimensions** | Higher dimensions (1536+) improve accuracy; lower dimensions favor cost/speed |
| **Cost** | Consider costs when indexing large document volumes |
| **Update Frequency** | Evaluate re-indexing costs when model updates occur |

### 19.4. Indexing Strategy

- **Vector DB Selection**: pgvector (PostgreSQL integration), Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, etc.
- **Metadata Filtering**: Combine vector search with metadata filters for precise retrieval
- **Periodic Index Updates**: Incremental index updates triggered by source document changes

---

## Part XX: Advanced Chunking Strategies

### 20.1. Chunking Method Comparison

| Method | Description | Recommended Case |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Fixed-Size** | Split by fixed length | Uniform text |
| **Recursive** | Recursively split with hierarchical separators | Structured documents |
| **Semantic** | Split at meaning boundaries (based on embedding similarity) | Dense technical documents |
| **Sliding Window** | Windows with overlap | Prevent context loss |
| **Agent-Based** | AI dynamically determines split points | Complex/mixed documents |
| **LLM-Based** | LLM splits based on context and meaning | Highest accuracy (high cost) |

### 20.2. Chunking Design Principles

- **Rule 40.24**: Determine chunk size by balancing retrieval accuracy and context preservation (recommended: 256-1024 tokens)
- **Overlap**: Set 10-20% overlap between adjacent chunks to prevent context loss at boundaries
- **Metadata Attachment**: Attach source document name, section name, page number, creation date, etc. as metadata to each chunk
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Embed surrounding context summaries into chunks so isolated chunks retain meaning

---

## Part XXI: Hybrid Search

### 21.1. Hybrid Search Strategy

- **Rule 40.25**: Use **hybrid** keyword search (BM25) and vector search as standard for RAG retrieval
- Keyword search excels at exact matches and proper nouns; vector search excels at semantic similarity. Combining both maximizes search quality

### 21.2. Fusion Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** | Convert each result's rank to reciprocal and sum. Simple and effective |
| **Weighted Fusion** | Sum keyword and vector scores with weights |
| **Cascading** | Narrow candidates with cheap search, rerank with high-accuracy search |

### 21.3. Metadata Filtering

- Filter by category, date range, document type, etc. during search to narrow search space
- **Pre-Filter vs Post-Filter**: For large datasets, recommend Pre-Filter (before search) for performance advantage

## Part XXII: Reranking

### 22.1. Reranking Strategies

- **Rule 40.26**: Recommend applying **reranking** after initial retrieval to improve RAG search result accuracy

| Method | Accuracy | Cost | Latency |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Cross-Encoder** | High | Medium | Medium |
| **LLM-as-Reranker** | Highest | High | High |
| **Cohere Rerank** | High | Medium (API billing) | Low |
| **BGE Reranker** | High | Low (self-hosted) | Medium |

### 22.2. Reranking Design Principles

- **Top-K → Rerank → Top-N**: Retrieve Top-K (e.g., 20) in initial search, narrow to Top-N (e.g., 5) via reranking
- **Cost/Accuracy Tradeoff**: Cross-Encoder offers optimal balance of accuracy and cost for production
- **Latency Budget**: Target keeping additional latency from reranking under 100ms

---

## Part XXXV: AI Destructive Command Ban & HITL

### 35.1. The AI Destructive Command Ban

- **Rule 40.36**: AI agents must not autonomously generate or execute destructive commands such as `rm`, `git rm`, `git restore` without explicit user permission
- **Text Asset Immunity**: Document asset deletion is "project memory loss." Even if technically possible, self-censor as a "prohibited operation"
- **Exception**: Obvious cleanup like `.DS_Store` or `node_modules` deletion is exempt (not applicable to text assets)

### 35.2. The Human-in-the-Loop Protocol (HITL)

- **Rule 40.37**: AI agents respond based on past context and may fixate on outdated information or incorrect assumptions. Users have an obligation to correct context without hesitation when AI heads in the wrong direction
- **Rationale**: Allowing AI to run unchecked is supervisory negligence. AI is a "tool," and operational responsibility always rests with humans

### 35.3. Human Approval Gate Design

| Operation Type | Approval Level |
|:---|:---|
| **Read (Search/Reference)** | Auto-execute allowed |
| **Create (New Data Generation)** | Display draft → Approval |

| **Premium** | 100/day | 10/day | 20/day |

### 37.2. AI Tier Metering Protocol

- **Rule 40.40**: AI feature usage counts must be **strictly metered and recorded server-side**, linked to billing systems
  1. **Atomic Counting**: Record counts within transactions on successful API calls
  2. **Graceful Denial**: Notify users with friendly UI like "You've reached today's usage limit"
  3. **No Bypass**: Prohibit direct client API calls, physically preventing metering bypass

### 37.3. Over-Limit Strategy

- Flexible overage handling via point billing (pay-as-you-go)
- Display countdown to next reset

### 39.4. Optical Data Entry (OCR/Vision)

- **Optical Archive**: Auto-convert physical documents to structured data via Vision AI. Provide "camera" UX instead of "input forms"
- **AI Data Entry Confirmation Protocol**: Prohibit AI-extracted data direct DB writes (Auto-Save). Always follow "Draft → Confirm → Save" flow
- **OCR Output PII Scrubbing**: Do not save PII outside service purposes as structured data; discard or mask
- **Cross-Reference**: PII Scrubbing (§XVIII), Data Minimization (`60`, `61`)

                   ├── Yes → [Context Assembly] → [Generate] → [Verify]
                   └── No  → [Rewrite Query] → Loop (max 3)
```

### 49.3. Corrective RAG (CRAG / Self-Reflective RAG)

- **Definition**: RAG pattern that evaluates retrieval result quality and modifies queries for re-retrieval when insufficient
- **Grader Model**: Small LLM or fine-tuned classifier that judges relevance in 3 levels (Relevant / Ambiguous / Irrelevant)
- **Action branching**:
  - `Relevant` → Use as context
  - `Ambiguous` → Rewrite query + additional retrieval
  - `Irrelevant` → Fallback to web search, or respond with "Information not found"
- **Rule 40.47**: Corrective RAG Grader thresholds must be tuned quarterly using evaluation datasets

### 49.4. Adaptive RAG

- **Definition**: RAG pattern that dynamically switches retrieval strategies based on query complexity
- **Routing decisions**:
  - **Simple Query** → Direct LLM response (no retrieval needed)
  - **Factual Query** → Standard vector search
  - **Complex Query** → Multi-step search + reranking
  - **Real-Time Query** → Web search + fact-checking
- **Effect**: Cost reduction by skipping unnecessary retrieval; optimal accuracy per query type

### 49.5. RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval)

- **Definition**: RAG optimization technique that recursively summarizes documents and builds hierarchical tree-structured indices
- **Process**:
  1. Split source documents into leaf nodes (small chunks)
  2. Cluster similar chunks
  3. Generate summaries for each cluster using LLM
  4. Further cluster and summarize summaries (recursive)
  5. Index all levels of chunks + summaries
- **Advantage**: Multi-resolution search capable of handling both detailed fact retrieval and high-level conceptual questions
- **Application Case**: Long documents, systematic knowledge like FAQs

### 49.6. Late Chunking

- **Definition**: Technique that generates token-level embeddings by passing the entire document through a Transformer before applying chunk boundaries
- **Advantage**: Each chunk's embedding retains full document context, preventing information loss from anaphora and long-distance references
- **Comparison with traditional approach**:
  - **Early Chunking** (traditional): Split first → Embed each chunk independently → Context loss risk
  - **Late Chunking**: Embed first → Split later → Context preserved
- **Constraint**: Documents exceeding Transformer's max token length require pre-splitting

### 49.7. Contextual Embeddings / Contextual Retrieval

- **Rule 40.48**: Recommend adding document-level context information (surrounding summaries, section names, document types) to chunks before embedding
- **Effect**: Even isolated chunks retain knowledge of "which document's which section this describes," significantly improving retrieval accuracy
- **Implementation Pattern**: Auto-generate 1-2 sentence context descriptions per chunk using LLM and prepend to chunk text

### 49.8. Query Transformation

| Method | Description | Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Query Rewriting** | Rewrite user queries into search-optimal form | Improved retrieval accuracy |
| **Query Decomposition** | Decompose compound questions into multiple sub-queries | Complex question handling |
| **HyDE** | Generate hypothetical answers and search using their embeddings | Bridging semantic gaps |
| **Step-Back Prompting** | Search with abstracted higher-level concepts then drill down | Broad knowledge acquisition |

- **Cross-Reference**: RAG Foundation Design (§XIX), Hybrid Search (§XXI), Reranking (§XXII)

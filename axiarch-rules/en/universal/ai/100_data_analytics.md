## Part I: Analytics Philosophy & Core Principles

### 1.1. Primary Directive

- **Day 1 Design**: Instrumenting analytics and observability after release is prohibited. Embed telemetry from the design phase
- **Privacy > Measurement**: User privacy takes precedence over any analytics requirement
- **Signal over Noise**: Collect only "meaningful signals", not "everything possible"

### 1.2. Three Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data-Informed** | Data is an "input to improve decision quality", not the "sole truth". Humans make the final call |
| **Privacy by Default** | Zero data collection without consent. PII must never enter the analytics pipeline |
| **Actionable Only** | Do not measure metrics that are merely "interesting to look at". Define only metrics that drive action |

### 1.3. Separation of Analytics & Observability Concerns

| Domain | Purpose | Audience | Representative Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Product Analytics** | Understand user behavior & track growth metrics | PM / Marketing / Executives | Amplitude, Mixpanel, GA4 |
| **Observability** | Visualize system internal state & rapidly identify failures | SRE / Engineers | Datadog, Grafana, New Relic |
| **Data Quality** | Ensure data pipeline health & accuracy | Data Engineers | Great Expectations, Monte Carlo, Soda |

---

## Part II: Event Design & Event Taxonomy

### 2.1. Event Naming Conventions

- **Law**: All event names use `snake_case`. Spaces and camelCase are **prohibited**
- **Format**: Use `{object}_{action}` pattern (e.g., `product_viewed`, `cart_item_added`, `checkout_completed`)
- **Consistency**: The same action uses the same event name across all platforms (Web/iOS/Android)

```
// ✅ Good
product_viewed
cart_item_added
checkout_completed

// ❌ Bad
ProductViewed          // camelCase prohibited
product viewed         // spaces prohibited
view_product           // action_object is non-standard (use object_action)
```

### 2.2. Event Schema Design

- **Required Properties**: Attach the following context to all events

```json
{
  "event": "product_viewed",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-20T13:00:00Z",
  "properties": {
    "product_id": "prod_abc123",
    "category": "dog_food",
    "source": "search_results",
    "session_id": "sess_xyz",
    "platform": "web"
  },
  "user_properties": {
    "user_type": "member",
    "plan": "premium"
  }
}
```

- **Cardinality Control**: High-cardinality properties (full URLs, raw search queries, etc.) must be grouped/normalized before sending
- **Prohibited Properties**: PII (email, name, phone, IP address) must NEVER be included in event properties

### 2.3. Schema Registry & Governance

- **Schema Registry**: Manage all event definitions as JSON Schema; detect and block undefined events in CI
- **Data Dictionary**: Document each event's purpose, properties, owner, and creation date
- **Periodic Audit**: Conduct quarterly event inventory. Events unused for 90 days are deletion candidates
- **Event Addition Process**: PR-based request → Data team review → Implementation after approval

### 2.4. Event Quality Assurance

- **QA Checklist**:
  1. Does the event name comply with naming conventions?
  2. Are all required properties included?
  3. Are property types consistent (no string/number mixing)?
  4. Is PII absent?
  5. Is debouncing applied to prevent duplicate firing?
- **Automated Validation**: Integrate schema validation in CI/CD pipeline; block violations at PR level

---

## Part III: Product Analytics

### 3.1. North Star Metric (NSM)

- **Definition**: The single metric that most accurately reflects the product's long-term value
- **Examples**: Spotify → Total listening time, Airbnb → Nights booked, Slack → DAU messages sent
- **Company-wide Alignment**: NSM must be understood by everyone from engineers to CS, all contributing to its improvement
- **Cadence**: Daily auto-aggregation, weekly trend review

### 3.2. AARRR (Pirate Metrics) KPI Framework

| Stage | KPI Examples | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| **Acquisition** | Monthly new registrations | `sign_up` event |
| **Activation** | First core action completion rate | `first_action_completed` event |
| **Retention** | 7-day / 30-day / 90-day retention rate | Cohort analysis |
| **Revenue** | ARPU / MRR / LTV | Payment + ad revenue |
| **Referral** | Referral-driven registration rate / K-factor | Referral code tracking |

### 3.3. Funnel Analysis

- Visualize drop-off points from sign-up through payment to core feature usage
- **Drop-off Threshold**: If any step shows >30% drop-off, improvement becomes top priority
- **Segmented Funnels**: Decompose by device, traffic source, and user type

### 3.4. Cohort Analysis

- **Retention Cohorts**: Compare retention of "users who used Feature X" vs "users who didn't"
- **Magic Number Identification**: Find the action threshold that determines product stickiness (e.g., 3 posts within 7 days → 2× retention)
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Group users by specific behavior patterns and analyze over time

### 3.5. Real-Time Analytics

- **Use Cases**: KPI monitoring immediately after releases, traffic monitoring at campaign launch
- **Latency Requirements**: Real-time dashboard data lag must be **under 60 seconds**
- **Supplementary Role**: Daily decisions use batch-processed data. Real-time is limited to anomaly detection and incident response

---

## Part IV: Behavioral & Session Analysis

### 4.1. Session Replay

- **Purpose**: Reconstruct actual user operations as video to understand the "why" behind quantitative data
- **Privacy**: Input field contents and PII display areas require automatic masking
- **Sampling**: Recording all sessions is unnecessary. Prioritize error sessions and abandonment sessions
- **Data Retention**: Session replay data must be auto-deleted within **30 days**

### 4.2. UX Friction Detection

| Friction Type | Definition | Detection Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Rage Click** | 5+ clicks on the same element in rapid succession | Click event time-delta & coordinate analysis |
| **Dead Click** | Click on non-interactive element | DOM element `pointer-events` attribute check |
| **Error Click** | Click followed by error response (4xx/5xx) | Click → API response correlation |
| **Thrashed Cursor** | Irregular high-speed mouse cursor movement | Cursor trajectory speed & direction analysis |
| **Form Abandonment** | Mid-form exit | Focus/blur/submit tracking |

- **Auto-Alert**: Trigger Slack notification + auto-issue creation when Rage Click / Dead Click exceeds threshold

### 4.3. Heatmaps

- **Click Heatmap**: Visualize where users click
- **Scroll Heatmap**: Measure content reach rate (below-the-fold percentage)
- **Attention Heatmap**: Estimate user gaze dwell (mouse-tracking based)
- **SPA Note**: In SPAs, separate heatmap measurement per route transition

---

## Part V: A/B Testing & Experimentation Protocol

### 5.1. Culture of Experimentation

- **Rule**: New major features and UI changes must be wrapped in **Feature Flags** for phased rollout
- **Hypothesis Validation**: "Ship and hope" is prohibited. Strictly follow: Hypothesis → Experiment → Measure → Decide

### 5.2. 4-Phase Experiment Protocol

| Phase | Content | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Hypothesis** | "Changing X will improve Y by Z%" format | Experiment plan |
| **2. Experiment** | Split traffic via Feature Flag to A/B groups | Implementation PR |
| **3. Measurement** | Minimum **2 weeks** or **1,000+ sessions per group** | Event data |
| **4. Decision** | Adopt only when statistical significance is confirmed (**p < 0.05**) | Decision report |

### 5.3. Statistical Requirements

- **Confidence Interval**: 95% or higher (p < 0.05)
- **Statistical Power**: 80% or higher
- **Sample Size**: Pre-calculate required sample size before experiment start
- **Multiple Comparison Correction**: Apply Bonferroni correction or Benjamini-Hochberg for 3+ groups
- **SRM Detection**: Automatically detect Sample Ratio Mismatch and alert

### 5.4. Advanced Experimentation Techniques

- **Bayesian A/B Testing**: In addition to frequentist methods, use Bayesian estimation for early decision-making. Directly calculate "probability that B is better than A" from the posterior distribution
- **CUPED**: Use pre-experiment data as covariates to reduce variance by up to 50%, drastically compressing required sample size
- **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)**: Dynamic traffic allocation optimization. Automatically manage explore/exploit trade-off
- **Interleaving**: Used for search result / recommendation quality comparison. Detect significance with fewer samples
- **Holdout Group**: Exclude a subset of users from all experiments to measure long-term impact

### 5.5. Experiment Prioritization

| Priority | Target |
|---|---|
| **Mandatory** | Registration flow, search UI, primary conversion paths |
| **Recommended** | Landing pages, CTA copy, email subject lines, price display |
| **Not Required** | Security features, legal compliance UI, accessibility |

### 5.6. Guardrail Metrics

- **Definition**: Safety metrics to detect experiment side effects (churn rate, crash rate, page load time, etc.)
- **Auto-Monitoring**: Automatically track guardrail metrics for all experiments. Auto-stop experiment on degradation
- **Prohibited**: Adopting results that degrade guardrail metrics

### 5.7. Prohibited Practices

- Decision-making without statistical significance (**HiPPO problem** avoidance)
- Experiments that harm users (dark patterns)
- Simultaneous execution ignoring mutual interference between experiments

### 5.8. Causal AI Integration & Adaptive Experimentation

- **Causal Inference Integration**: Feed A/B test results into causal inference models to estimate long-term causal effects (see Part LI)
- **Adaptive Experimentation**: Dynamically adjust sample allocation based on in-experiment data. Balance ethical considerations and statistical rigor
- **What-if Simulation**: Counterfactual simulations using past experiment data to improve new experiment design accuracy

---

## Part VI: Privacy-First Analytics

### 6.1. Absolute PII Transmission Prohibition

- **Strictly Prohibited**: Sending the following data to analytics platforms is **absolutely forbidden**
  - Email addresses, names, phone numbers, addresses
  - Device IDs (IDFA / GAID) without user consent
  - IP addresses (without anonymization)
  - Date of birth, credit card information
- **Hashing**: Use salted SHA-256 hash IDs when user identification is needed
- **Validation**: Auto-run PII pattern scans (email regex, etc.) in CI pipeline

### 6.2. Consent Management

- **GDPR / Global Privacy Laws / CCPA**: Strictly respect user consent status
- **Explicit Consent**: Analytics cookies/tracking require **opt-in** (implicit consent prohibited)
- **Script Control**: Do not load analytics scripts without consent (implement Consent Mode)
- **GPC**: Respect browser Global Privacy Control signals for universal opt-out

```javascript
// Consent Mode implementation pattern
if (consentStatus === 'granted') {
  loadAnalyticsSDK();
} else {
  // Fallback: privacy-preserving aggregation only
  loadPrivacyFirstCounter();
}
```

### 6.3. Post-Cookie Era Measurement Strategy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Google Privacy Sandbox (Topics API / Attribution Reporting API) was **officially discontinued in 2025**.
> Chrome maintains a user-choice model rather than phased third-party cookie deprecation.
> Migrate to the following strategies immediately.

- **Server-Side Measurement**: Send events server-side via GA4 Measurement Protocol / Conversion API
- **First-Party Data First**: Design measurement that relies ZERO on third-party cookies
- **Data Clean Rooms**: Use data clean rooms (Google Ads Data Hub, etc.) for ad platform data matching
- **IPA**: Monitor Interoperable Private Attribution as an emerging industry standard for privacy-preserving attribution
- **Deterministic Matching**: Focus investment on login-ID-based cross-platform measurement

### 6.4. Data Minimization Principle

- **Event Minimization**: Prohibit collecting events without documented purpose
- **Property Minimization**: Prohibit attaching unnecessary properties to events
- **Retention Period**: Clearly define analytics data retention (recommended: raw data 13 months, aggregated data 3 years)
- **Right to Deletion**: Pre-build response flows for GDPR Article 17 data deletion requests

### 6.5. Differential Privacy

- **Aggregate-Level Protection**: Only permit data aggregation in forms that cannot identify individuals
- **Noise Injection**: Add calibrated noise to aggregated results to conceal individual contributions
- **Applicable Scope**: Small-sample aggregations, externally shared reports, ML training data
- **PETs Deep Dive**: For advanced PETs (federated learning, TEE, etc.), see Part LII

---

## Part VII: GA4 / Analytics Platform Integration

### 7.1. GA4 Event Design Standards

- **Naming Convention**: `snake_case` unified (e.g., `store_detail_view`, `review_submit`)
- **Custom Dimensions**: Always attach `user_type` (`guest` / `member` / `admin`)
- **E-commerce Events**: Full compliance with GA4 recommended schema (`view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `purchase`, etc.)
- **Custom Event Limits**: Design considering GA4 limits (500 custom events/properties)

### 7.2. Data Stream Design

- **Web / iOS / Android**: Separate data streams by platform
- **Enhanced Measurement**: Enable automatic measurement of scrolls, outbound clicks, site search, etc.
- **Debug Mode**: Use DebugView during development to instantly verify event firing

### 7.3. BigQuery Integration

- **Export**: Mandatory daily GA4 → BigQuery export configuration
- **Cost Management**: Use partitioned tables considering BigQuery scan volume
- **Advanced Analytics**: Execute SQL-based funnel analysis and attribution analysis in BigQuery
- **BigQuery AI**: Leverage BigQuery ML / AI Query Engine for unstructured data integration analysis

---

## Part VIII: CDP & Customer Data Platforms

### 8.1. Composable CDP Strategy

- **Modular Design**: Separate data ingestion, unification, and activation; compose best-of-breed
- **DWH-Centric**: Use DWH (BigQuery/Snowflake) as CDP persistence layer (Reverse ETL)
- **Vendor Lock-in Avoidance**: Avoid full dependency on specific CDP; maintain data layer independence

### 8.2. Identity Resolution

- **Deterministic Matching**: Reliable linkage via login ID, email hash, etc.
- **Probabilistic Matching Prohibited**: Probabilistic ID resolution is prohibited in principle due to privacy risks
- **Cross-Platform**: Unify Web/App/Offline touchpoints with a single identity

### 8.3. First-Party Data Utilization

- **Zero-Party Data**: Prioritize data voluntarily provided by users (preferences, interests)
- **Server-Side API**: Route analytics data via server-side APIs to circumvent browser tracking restrictions
- **Data Clean Rooms**: Use data clean rooms for ad platform data matching

---

## Part IX: KPI Framework & Metric Governance

### 9.1. KPI Tree Design

- **NSM at the Top**: North Star Metric → Input Metrics → Health Metrics hierarchy
- **Metric Definition Docs**: Document each metric's name, formula, data source, owner, and update frequency
- **OKR Alignment**: Explicitly map quarterly OKR Key Results to KPIs

### 9.2. Metric Governance

- **Metric Ownership**: Assign a responsible owner to each KPI
- **Definition Uniqueness**: Prohibit the same metric operating under multiple definitions (SSOT principle)
- **Change Management**: Require PR-based review for metric formula/definition changes
- **Vanity Metric Elimination**: Periodically inventory and remove "vanity metrics" that drive no action

### 9.3. Metric Reliability

- **Data Freshness**: Explicitly state each metric's data update lag (real-time / daily / weekly)
- **Precision Display**: Accompany sampling-based metrics with sample size and confidence intervals
- **Anomaly Detection**: Auto-alert when metric values exceed ±3σ from historical average

---

## Part X: Dashboard Quality Standards

### 10.1. Dashboard Data Integrity Standard

- **Law**: Dashboard quality metrics must be based on actual DB schema columns. Deviation from schema is prohibited
- **Schema-Based Metrics**: `IS NOT NULL` checks must reference real columns. Validation against DB type definitions is mandatory
- **DTO-UI Alignment**: When adding DTO fields, update UI destructuring. `NaN`/`undefined`/`null` display is a bug
- **Distinct Denominator**: Apply `distinct` processing to funnel denominators. `total > 0` guard is mandatory

### 10.2. Dashboard UX Standards

- **Tooltip Required**: All metric items need tooltips with "what it measures" + "why it matters"
- **5-Second Rule**: System health must be judgeable within 5 seconds of viewing the dashboard
- **Drill-down**: All metric values must be clickable to navigate to detail views
- **Last Updated Timestamp**: Always display the last update timestamp for users to assess data freshness

### 10.3. Dashboard Operations

- **Dashboard Inventory**: Quarterly deletion of unused dashboards (zero access for 90 days)
- **Git Management**: Dashboard definitions version-controlled via Observability as Code (see Part XXXIII)
- **Access Control**: Role-based dashboard view permissions. Dashboards containing PII require approval

---

## Part XI: Observability Core Principles

### 11.1. Five Pillars of Observability

| Pillar | Signal | Purpose | Representative Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Metrics** | Numerical time series | Quantitative system health | Prometheus / OTLP |
| **Logs** | Structured events | Detailed event recording & debugging | Fluentd / OTLP |
| **Traces** | Distributed transactions | Request path & latency identification | OpenTelemetry |
| **Profiles** | CPU/Memory usage distribution | Code-level bottleneck identification | pprof / OTel Profiling |
| **Events** | Discrete occurrences | Deploy / config change tracking | CloudEvents |

### 11.2. Observability 2.0

- **Context Unification**: Correlate logs, metrics, and traces for integrated analysis rather than viewing individually
- **High Cardinality**: Shift from traditional metrics-centric to high-cardinality event data-centric approach
- **Business Alignment**: Auto-detect correlations between technical metrics and business KPIs (Revenue-Linked Observability)
- **Observability Graph**: Provide a real-time "map" of the entire system as a new concept dynamically replacing traditional CMDBs (see Part XLIII)
- **Entity Model**: Standardize resource relationship modeling via OTel Entity Model (see Part L)

### 11.3. Fundamental Laws of Observability

- **Three Whys**: Must answer: "What happened" → "Where it happened" → "Why it happened"
- **Cardinality Management**: Prevent metric label explosion. Pre-define upper limits for label values
- **Telemetry & Privacy**: Apply PII prevention rules to telemetry data (e.g., never log user emails)

---

## Part XII: OpenTelemetry Architecture

### 12.1. OTel Collector Design

- **Deployment Pattern**: Recommended 2-tier with Agent (sidecar) + Gateway (aggregation layer)

```
[Application] → [OTel SDK] → [Agent Collector (per node)]
                                    ↓
                           [Gateway Collector (aggregation & routing)]
                                    ↓
                    [Backend: Grafana / Datadog / Jaeger etc.]
```

- **Pipeline Design**: Separate Receiver → Processor → Exporter pipelines by signal type (Metrics/Logs/Traces)
- **Version**: Use stable versions post OTel Collector v1.0 GA. Experimental components in production are prohibited

### 12.2. Instrumentation Strategy

- **Auto-Instrumentation First**: Maximize OTel SDK auto-instrumentation; manual instrumentation only for gaps
- **eBPF Instrumentation (OBI)**: Leverage OTel eBPF Instrumentation (OBI) for zero-code-change RED (Rate/Error/Duration) metrics, service graphs, and traces. Plan migration to OBI 1.0 stable (2026 target)
- **Library Instrumentation**: Use official OTel libraries for HTTP / gRPC / DB client instrumentation
- **Hybrid Instrumentation**: Recommend hybrid approach combining OBI auto-instrumentation + SDK manual instrumentation

### 12.3. OTel Best Practices

- **Attribute Management**: Use attribute names compliant with Semantic Conventions v1.38+
- **Batch Processing**: Use batch mode for Exporters (avoid load from real-time sequential sends)
- **Sampling**: Combine Head-based + Tail-based sampling
  - Normal traffic: 10% sampling
  - Errors/high latency: 100% capture
- **Resource Limits**: Set Collector memory/CPU usage caps (prevent OOM Kill)

### 12.4. OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol)

- **Law**: Use **OTLP** as the standard protocol for telemetry transmission
- **gRPC Preferred**: OTLP/gRPC for performance-critical environments; OTLP/HTTP for firewall-constrained environments
- **OTLP Arrow**: Leverage stateful OTLP for improved transfer efficiency in large-scale environments
- **OTLP v1.0.0+**: Support latest Protobuf schema (including initial Profiles support)

### 12.5. OTel 2026 Roadmap Alignment

- **Declarative Configuration**: JSON Schema-based declarative configuration reaches stable. Leverage configuration standardization and validation
- **OTTL Context Inference**: Leverage OpenTelemetry Transformation Language context inference to simplify transform processor definitions
- **GenAI Semantic Conventions**: Actively adopt AI/LLM semantic conventions (input/output token counts, model temperature, etc.)
- **Logs GA**: Logs signal reaches GA. Achieve full Metrics/Traces/Logs unification via OTLP unified schema
- **Ecosystem Explorer**: Reference OTel ecosystem's instrumentation and collection option navigation tools

### 12.6. OTel Entity Model & Client Instrumentation

- **Entity Model**: Service, process, and host relationship modeling via OTel Entity data model (see Part L)
- **Client Instrumentation**: RUM support for Web/Mobile/Desktop. Client model definition within OTel specification
- **Profiling GA**: Profiling stabilizes as a new signal type within OTLP. Integrated as Collector Receiver in pprof format
- **Unified Signals**: Unify 4 signals (Metrics, Traces, Logs, Profiles) through Entity Model linkage

---

## Part XIII: Distributed Tracing

### 13.1. Context Propagation

- **W3C Trace Context**: Propagate `traceparent` / `tracestate` headers on all HTTP requests
- **Baggage**: Propagate business context (`user_id_hash`, `feature_flag_variant`, etc.) via Baggage
- **Async Propagation**: Embed Trace Context in headers for async processing via message queues (Kafka, SQS, etc.)

### 13.2. Trace Quality

- **Span Naming**: `{service}.{operation}` format (e.g., `payment-service.process_refund`)
- **Span Attributes**: Attach context like error codes, status, DB queries (excluding parameters)
- **Span Links**: Connect related but separate traces via Span Links (e.g., order → payment → delivery)
- **Span Events**: Record significant in-span events (exceptions, retries, etc.) as Span Events

### 13.3. Sampling Strategy

| Strategy | Use Case | Configuration Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Head-Based** | Low-cost uniform sampling | Record 10% of all traces |
| **Tail-Based** | Complete capture of errors/high latency | `status=ERROR` → 100% recording |
| **Priority-Based** | Prioritized recording of critical transactions | Payment traces → 100%, health checks → 1% |

- **Law**: Error traces and SLO-violating traces are recorded at **100%**. They are exempt from sampling

---

## Part XIV: Metrics Design

### 14.1. RED Pattern (Service Metrics)

| Metric | Definition | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| **Rate** | Requests per second | Traffic volume understanding |
| **Errors** | Error response percentage (%) | Service quality monitoring |
| **Duration** | Response time distribution (p50/p95/p99) | Performance monitoring |

### 14.2. USE Pattern (Resource Metrics)

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Utilization** | Resource usage rate (%) | CPU / Memory / Disk |
| **Saturation** | Resource queue length / wait queue | Thread pool / Connection pool |
| **Errors** | Resource error count | I/O errors / Network errors |

### 14.3. Cardinality Management

- **Prevent Label Explosion**: Design so unique metric label values don't exceed 10,000
- **Prohibited Labels**: High-cardinality values like `user_id`, `request_id`, `session_id` are prohibited as metric labels
- **Histogram Bucket Design**: Set bucket boundaries aligned with SLO targets (e.g., 100ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2.5s, 5s, 10s)
- **Exponential Histogram**: Leverage OTel's Exponential Histogram for automated bucket optimization

### 14.4. Metric Naming Conventions

- `{namespace}_{subsystem}_{name}_{unit}` format
- Include units as suffix (`_seconds`, `_bytes`, `_total`)
- Counter types get `_total` suffix

```
// ✅ Good
http_server_request_duration_seconds
db_connection_pool_active_connections
payment_transaction_total

// ❌ Bad
httpRequestTime        // snake_case violation, no unit
request_count          // missing namespace
```

---

## Part XV: Logging Strategy

### 15.1. Structured Logging

- **Law**: All logs must be output as **JSON-formatted** structured logs. Plain text logs are prohibited
- **Required Fields**: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `service`, `trace_id`, `span_id`

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-20T13:00:00.000Z",
  "level": "error",
  "message": "Payment processing failed",
  "service": "payment-service",
  "trace_id": "abc123def456",
  "span_id": "789ghi012",
  "error_code": "PAYMENT_DECLINED",
  "amount": 1500,
  "currency": "JPY"
}
```

### 15.2. Log Level Definitions

| Level | Usage | Production Output |
|---|---|---|
| **FATAL** | Critical errors requiring process termination | ✅ |
| **ERROR** | Error occurred (recoverable) | ✅ |
| **WARN** | Potential issues / deprecated operation detection | ✅ |
| **INFO** | Normal business event recording | ✅ |
| **DEBUG** | Development-time debug information | ❌ (dev only) |
| **TRACE** | Detailed trace-level information | ❌ (special debug only) |

### 15.3. Log PII Prevention

- **Law**: Outputting PII (email, name, phone, credit card) in logs is **strictly prohibited**
- **Masking**: If identification info is unavoidable, configure automatic masking in the log pipeline
- **CI Verification**: Statically detect PII pattern literal output via lint rules

### 15.4. Logs-to-Metrics Conversion

- **OTel Collector Transform Processor**: Auto-extract metrics from logs
- **Use Cases**: Error log aggregation → error rate metrics, response time logs → latency histograms
- **Cost Optimization**: Convert high-volume logs to metrics, then shorten raw log retention period

---

## Part XVI: Continuous Profiling

### 16.1. The Fourth Signal

- **Positioning**: Formally integrated as the "4th signal" alongside Metrics / Logs / Traces
- **Purpose**: Continuously identify CPU/memory bottlenecks at code level (function granularity) in production
- **eBPF-Based**: Recommend OTel's eBPF-based Continuous Profiling agent (zero code changes)
- **OBI Integration**: Unified collection of traces, metrics, and profiles via OTel eBPF Instrumentation (OBI) profiler in a single agent

### 16.2. Profile Types

| Type | Target | Representative Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU Profile** | CPU time consumption distribution | Go pprof, async-profiler |
| **Heap Profile** | Memory allocation distribution | V8 heap snapshot, jemalloc |
| **Wall Clock** | Real-time consumption distribution (including I/O wait) | OTel Profiling |
